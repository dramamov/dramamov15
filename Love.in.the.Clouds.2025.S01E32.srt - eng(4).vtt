Are you all right?

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.660
Does this ring a bell?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.610
There's no escaping from this artifact

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.610
once you're inside.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.450
You told me you'd destroy it

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.660
after you took it away.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.010
You said Yaoguang Mountain despised all artifacts.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.410
And now you're using one to imprison me?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.540
Some artifacts can be used

to protect Yaoguang Mountain.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.660
Given that I served you as a child for 20 years

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.780

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.410
please

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.130

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.380
I will assume full responsibility.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.340
Everything I do

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.290
is for Yaoguang Mountain.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.780
It is a difficult decision,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.610
but it must be made.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.890
You made this artifact.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.610
You know you can't escape from it.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.500
No!

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.290
Ji Bozai. Don't come in!

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.100
It's too dangerous.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.010
Why did you come in?

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.820
Your Lordship already has a plan in mind.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.980
It is not my place to say more.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.610
But please remember this:

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.060
no matter what happens,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.060
you must not open the Spirit Well

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.100
until your spiritual power is fully restored.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.450
Otherwise,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.660
you might really suffer a relapse.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.660

He will wake up soon.

Saving you is just a simple favor.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.460
You stopped Ming Xin's conferment ceremony for me.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.540
In a way, you helped me

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.370
get back what is rightfully mine.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.850
We don't owe each other anymore.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.980

I know

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.780
there's no way I can compensate you for what they did.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.340
It has nothing to do with you anyway.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.220
I cannot hold it against you.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.660
It's...

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.290
It's such a cruel joke.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.340
I risked everything

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.490

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.850
the woman who saved me.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.580
But she was the one who abandoned me

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.540
and let me rot in prison.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.140
You know very well

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.850
that I don't resent you for it.

that when I see you,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.580

Your Majesty, no need to act like a benevolent father.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.460
Ming Xian was your son for 20 years,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.850
yet you discarded him

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.460
after he lost the Qingyun Tournament once.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.700
And I'm

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.890
a son who just came back.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.370
I came

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.340
to negotiate with you.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.610
I fail as a father.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.490
The two previous crown princes were incompetent,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.130
and the one before me

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.700
wants to negotiate with me.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.420
You don't care who your real son is.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.650
You just want someone

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.940
who can make Yaoguang Mountain stronger.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.180
As expected of someone carrying my bloodline.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.220
Yes.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.220
Who Ming Xian is doesn't matter.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.340
What I want

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.650
is a warrior who can win in the Qingyun Tournament

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.980
and a crown prince who commands the people's respect.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.580
I'm doing this

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.700
for the prosperity of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.730
Speak.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.180
What can I offer to convince you

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.890
to be the crown prince?

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.980
One, I will join the warrior ranks.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.420
I will command all warriors.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.010
Sure. That is rightfully yours anyway.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.610
Two, the Empress, Jing Shu, shall live.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.820
Granted.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.490
She is my first wife.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.220
I promise that she will be cared for.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.340
Three,

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.530
forget past grudges with Jixing Abyss.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.100
Do not hunt down anything

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.490
or anyone with no relevance.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.130
Are you doing this for Ming Xian?

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.060
Like I said,

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.700
it's time to turn the page.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.610
Let it go now, Your Majesty.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.580
So Ji Bozai and I were swapped at birth.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.820
My birth mother

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.130
is a descendant of the Bo clan in Zhangwei Mountain of Jixing Abyss.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:27.980
In a sense,

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.730
you can say I'm from Jixing Abyss too.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.610
Lord Chengyun committed a crime,

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.850
so he cannot be the heir apparent.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.130
Yaoguang Mountain now needs

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.940
a new crown prince to appease everyone.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.530
But knowing him,

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.850
he won't even bat an eye even if someone

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.100
hands him Yaoguang Mountain for free.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.850
I'm guessing

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.370
that with us in Jixing Abyss, and him in Yaoguang Mountain,

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.300
we have the power of two realms

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.530
against Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.060
And perhaps he wants to be cautious

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.420
so he didn't tell us about his plan.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.730
- Look. - What does it say?

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.610
The Emperor of Yaoguang hereby declares to all Six Realms

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.340
that Ming Xin, Lord Chengyun,

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.730
defied the law

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.610
and will be deposedf.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.530
The Emperor's eldest son, Ji Bozai, shall be the crown prince

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.180
to restore law and order.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.580
- He is the crown prince? Impossible. - I can't believe it.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.890
There's no way Ji Bozai is the emperor's son.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.610
Can you believe it?

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.370
It's like a joke.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.490
Ming Xin should abdicate.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:37.850
But Ji Bozai cannot be the crown prince either.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:38.580
- Is this true? - Let's go.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.730
Let's ask the authority.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:40.650
How come Ji Bozai

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.130
is the son of the Emperor of Yaoguang?

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:42.820
What about Ming Xian?

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.770
- Exactly. - They didn't mention Ming Xian.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.420
He must be punished.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:53.490
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.060

- Exactly. - This is not right.

I urge you to make the decision

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.850

This is from Immortal Lun'an.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.980
Ji Bozai infiltrated Jixing Abyss and colluded with our enemy.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.460
He committed a great crime.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.730
Our warriors must be gathered to hunt him down.

This is from Immortal He.

Enough.

They are all probably asking me to hunt Ji Bozai down.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.420
In Mingshi Hall today,

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.820
the immortals have already questioned Her Majesty

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.140
about Ji Bozai.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.220
Can you believe it?

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.620
Has it not crossed their minds

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.660
that Ji Bozai was the one who defeated Ming Xian in the tournament

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.290
and won the Blessed Rain for Jixing Abyss?

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.980
If Ji Bozai was working with Yaoguang Mountain,

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.090
why would he win in the tournament?

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.980
Being a warrior in Jixing Abyss and being a crown prince in Yaoguang Mountain

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.090
are two different things.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.530
They don't know Ji Bozai.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.290
They only view him as Jixing Abyss's weapon.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.530
Now that they know

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:41.620
Ji Bozai is the crown prince of Yaoguang Mountain,

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.660
the citizens fear

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.050
that this weapon

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.810
will be directed at them.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.330
It is understandable.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.140
Right.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.980
And as the Empress,

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.330

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.460
Twenty-Seven.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.660
I missed you so much.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.140
I knew it.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.220
I knew you'd return.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:14.620
I'm sorry, Twenty-Seven.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.090
I failed to protect you.

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.940
I...

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:21.860
It's all right.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:23.940
It's all right.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.330
Come.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.660
I was waiting for you to come back.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.050
I was waiting and waiting.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.700
And finally, you came back.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:35.810
Come.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.180
Eat anything you want.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.420
But not in excess.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.940
Even if you shed your fur on the bed,

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.860
you're still welcome on it.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.330
Welcome home,

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:45.290
Twenty-Seven.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.700
We have enough.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.900
You can climb anywhere you want.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.620
Is this home?

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.940
Home is where your family is.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.700
What fur is this?

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.490
It's not white or blond.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.900
How come it's this color?

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:04.980
Ming Yi,

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.090
all this time, my divine consciousness

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.530
was in the bell.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.530
I could hear everything,

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.090
including what happened to you recently

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.570
and Ji Bozai.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:17.770
You...

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.570
Twenty-Seven.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:24.250
Ji Bozai will not betray Jixing Abyss

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.770
and side with Yaoguang Mountain.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.090
What do you think? Not spicy, right?

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:33.810
You heard everything?

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.940
How long have you kept this dried fish?

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.180
What? It's fresh.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.570
- It's stale. - Then don't eat it.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.700
How can you stop me from eating after I've eaten half of it?

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.570
Master She is convalescing in Wugui Sea.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:46.700
Don't worry about him.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:47.860
No one knows he's here.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.140
Thank you, Granny Xun.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:51.010
By the way,

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.090
His Lordship wrote back

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:54.330
and said he knew what he was doing.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.980
He told me not to worry.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.380
But His Lordship always leaves the bad news out.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.770
How can I not be worried about him?

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.940
I overlooked this

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.010
and forgot to brief you in advance.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.050
Everyone is saying His Lordship is a traitor outside.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.490
Of course, I don't believe those idiots.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.180
His Lordship risks his life for Jixing Abyss.

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:17.380
We all saw that.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.140
But how can the Empress be so gullible

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.660
and trust those fake rumors?

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:23.980
She even put up a notice in the Parade Bureau

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.420
to strip His Lordship of his titles as the warrior and the honorary warrior.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.180
Her decision is...

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.140
is very disheartening.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.220
Ji Bozai

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.620
has now joined the warrior ranks

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.730
of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.530
As the Empress, Tianji has to reassure

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.810
everyone in Jixing Abyss.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:44.770
If Ji Bozai were in Tianji's shoes,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.700
he would have done the same.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.140
I understand the burden

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.290
on Her Majesty's shoulders.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.140
But this is a cruel joke.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.940
I feel bad for you and him, who are supposed to be together.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.620
What will become of you and him?

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.220
Who knows what the future holds?

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.460
But right now,

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.530
exposing what the Emperor of Zhushui did

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.700
is what he and I want to do.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.700
We will persevere.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.010
Ji Bozai wants to bring peace to the Six Realms.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.490
He is determined. That won't change.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.330
I believe in him.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.180
I see.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.220
I will look after His Lordship's home

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.900
in Wugui Sea.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.810
Thank you, Granny Xun.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.380
It's a new recipe.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:40.140
You made this?

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:41.620
Let me smell it.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.490
It'll cool you down.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.330
It smells amazing.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:45.860
Let me take a bite.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.620
Do you like it?

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.420
It has six flowers in it.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.140
A minimum of four warriors

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.460
is required to take part in the Qingyun Tournament.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.220
Now that Ji Bozai has joined the rival realm,

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.420
we won't even have four warriors.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.010
How are we supposed to scout out the tournament arena now?

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:12.460
What about promoting one from the shortlisted candidates?

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.220
Worry not.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:21.980
I've told them

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.530
that we would gather enough warriors before the tournament.

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:26.980
Therefore, they won't

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.010
disqualify us for now.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:31.290
Furthermore, Ming Yi also agreed

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.860
to scout with us as a Forger

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.810
representing the Shouhua Academy.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:36.900
Great!

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.730
If other immortals raise dissenting opinions,

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.140
don't worry or be affected

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.570
by them.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.530
I'll handle them for you.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:51.620
Great!

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.490
Great!

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.620
It's on.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.700
I didn't know

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.700
that you could use a fire-igniting artifact for barbecue purposes.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.330
Only a genius like me

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.700
can come up with such a great idea.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.620
Right. This is almost burned.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:12.530
Eat some, Twenty-Seven.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.380
Yan Xiao. Eat with us.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:22.530
You can train later!

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.490
This seems like the right time

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.570
to tell you that you should rest.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.050
But?

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.490
But

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.940
the two-realm tournament is about to begin.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.810
We should all train harder.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.490
Therefore, I brought you an ointment.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:08.330
Do you feel better now?

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.730
Yes.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:31.050
Meng, you are smiling.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.570
Do not laugh at me.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.700
Truth be told,

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.090
I like them this way.

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.530
I like Tianji.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:43.860
I like her a lot.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:46.090
Even now.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.490
But my feelings toward her

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.770
are that I just want her to be happy.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.010
Meng.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.380
I salute you.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.940
Do not steal my sweet potato.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.380
When we were in Yaoguang Mountain,

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.010
we had to abide by strict rules.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.770
The juniors had to serve the seniors.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.810
And even among peers, the strong would bully the weak.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.860
Back then, I dreamed

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.140
of meeting a trustworthy ally.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:19.900
And to my surprise,

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.290
I found people whom I can fall back on

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.700
in Jixing Abyss.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.530
All participants,

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.620
following the order set down

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.050
by the previous Qingyun Tournament,

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.620
you may now enter the Zhuojin Tower to inspect the arena.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.380
Without Ji Bozai, I highly doubt Jixing Abyss

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.140
can send in any competent immortal

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.140
at all.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.330
So not only do they have an empress,

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.900
they also have a female warrior now.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:57.860
What?

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.090
Are you trying to lose again for the next seven years?

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:02.330
Can't expect anything decent from your foul mouth.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.620
I see you spent most of your time

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.290
sharpening your tongue, not your blade.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.980
If you have nothing nice to say,

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.530
say nothing at all.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.700
Warriors of Yaoguang Mountain, please enter.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.940
Immortal...

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.420
Long time no see, Immortal Ji.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:31.220
Alas, we are now competing

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:32.570
against one another.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.940
Indeed. We now represent different realms.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:39.860
See you in the arena.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.090
See you.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:00.570
What?

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.810
What is going on?

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:02.460
Where did she go?

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.620
- What's going on? - It's so sudden.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:21.570
I'm in the secret chamber of Dragon Carp Terrace.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.980
Did you truly believe you could kill me

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.170
after you kidnapped me here

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.570
with your spell?

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.940
The Ultimate Punishment hasn't taught you anything, it seems.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.610
You're as foolish as ever.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:36.490
Oh, really?

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.090
Look closely.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.740
Ming Yi, can I keep this hairpin as memorabilia?

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:43.860
It's my...

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.420
Situ Ling used his heart's blood

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.420
to save you.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.010
Perhaps you ought

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.650
to return the favor to your savior.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.130
I don't believe you.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:02.940
And even if you did capture him,

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.130
I can kill you now

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.980
before rescuing him.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:09.820
Ming Xian.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.650
Ming Yi. Run.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.300
Don't worry about me.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.650
Ming Xian,

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:19.820
with one snap of my finger,

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.210
I can suffocate him.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:22.900
Try me if you dare.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:24.420
And this time,

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.340
I will kill him

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.420
before you make a move.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.570
Run, Ming Yi.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.170
What do you want?

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.780
Put the Embers down.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:42.610
No, Ming Yi.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.940
Don't drop your weapon.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.460
Ming Xin will kill you.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:46.420
Quiet!

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:48.490
I will not leave you to die.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.860
Ming Yi,

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.210
you still care about me, don't you?

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.380
Now, kneel.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.860
No, Ming Yi. Do not kneel!

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.380
Ming Xian.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:21.420
Kneel now.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.130
Ming Xin.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.650
Are you out of your mind?

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:30.980
What makes you think you can make her kneel?

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.170
Kneel.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.210
Kneel!

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.090
I told you to kneel! Did you hear me?

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.170
Ming Xin.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:57.530
Even until now,

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.380
you're still using the power of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.530
That means

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.460
you still want to fight for Yaoguang Mountain.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.610
You ingratiated yourself

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.530
with the Emperor of Zhushui.

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:09.820
Do you feel no shame?

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.530
Have you forgotten that every technique you're using

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:13.490
comes from me?

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:14.170
Shut up!

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.980
I don't care what your motive is now.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.130
But back then,

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:27.610
I truly viewed you as my younger brother.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.300
We joined the warrior ranks together.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.010
I wanted to guide you to the proper path.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.010
I taught you everything I know.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.940
Now that you have mastered those techniques,

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.690
you've forgotten

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.610
what it means to be a warrior.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:40.900
Shut up!

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.940
You have no right to patronize me, Ming Xian.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.300
You outdo me in every regard.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.780
Even if I put in ten times or a hundred times more effort,

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.090
Father won't even look at me.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.940
But you!

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.050
You're just a mongrel!

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:00.050
Why must I suffer?

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.050
Why must I let an outsider

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.460
steal my thunder?

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.690
Today,

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.570
I will break your knees

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.820
so that you may never stand before me!

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:26.340
Watch out, Ming Yi!

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.380
Why would you risk your life

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:53.300
for an informant from Zhushui Spiritual State?

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.420
Situ...

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:03.380
Prince Chao Yuan once saved my life.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.820
I cannot leave him to die.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.300
You found out?

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:43.010
Your Highness.

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:45.650
How eager of you to dispose of him.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.300
Why? Is he about to snitch you out?

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:16.860
Ming Yi, I just want to protect you.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.530
Chao Yuan.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.380
Ming Xin said

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.820
you once saved me with your heart's blood.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.860
Of course, I'm grateful for you.

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:30.460
But he wouldn't have known about it

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.650
if you hadn't told him.

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:34.380
Also,

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:35.900
were you the one who taught him the art

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:38.490
of illusory assassination?

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.860
Your Highness.

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.610
I see you feel spiteful after receiving

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.050
the Ultimate Punishment.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.170
So now, you want to get out of Yaoguang Mountain

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.530
to kill Ming Xian?

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.210
We had a deal that day.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.900
You wanted me to bring Ming Xian to you,

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:22.010
and I didn't divulge it to your father.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:26.380
If you truly care so much about that wretched woman,

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.210
I suppose

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:32.300
I can leave her cold dead body for you.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.690
I just gave you

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.940
Zhushui's secret art of illusory assassination.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.340
While the warriors are scouting the arena,

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.690
you can use it to kidnap her from Zhuojin Tower.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.340
She is stronger than you.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.210
And you're weakened by the punishment.

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.490
You can't defeat her.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.940
But you can tell her

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.380
that you're holding me hostage.

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.780
After all, I saved her once.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.650
And show her this keepsake.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.130
That way,

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.570
she won't kill you right away.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.650
The records say

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.130
that to master the art of

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:31.050
illusory assassination,

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.860
the practitioner has to kill at least ten people.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.860
You've decided to be Chao Yuan,

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:40.940
and not Situ Ling.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.090
Is that so?

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.740
Ming Yi,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.460
whatever I did,

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:56.940
it's for you.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.420
Why? Why the obsession?

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:02.530
You don't trust me.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.460
No matter what I did,

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.460
you still won't trust me.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.170
Yet you trust Ji Bozai wholeheartedly.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.940
Why must it be him?

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:22.090
All I know is that

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.090
even if you're no longer the Situ Ling I know,

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:25.940
I

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.260
will still do everything I can to stop Chao Yuan

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.940
just like how Situ Ling did everything

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.490
to save me.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.130
Give up while you still can, Chao Yuan.

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:37.300
You mustn't be like your father.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.300
It's too late.

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:54.980
- Let's go. - Let's go.
