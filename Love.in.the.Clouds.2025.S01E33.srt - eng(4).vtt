00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.260
Who's that?

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.290
Ming Xin.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.050
Who's this?

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.980
It really is him.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.690
Why is he with Ming Yi and Ji Bozai?

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.980
Where did they go?

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.980
Yeah.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.130
I don't need your pity!

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.460
I never thought that after a lifetime of being jealous of you,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.820
I wouldn't even die by your hand in the end.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.620
What's going on?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.570
Ming Xin.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.610
He's injured.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.570
Isn't that Ming Xian's companion beast?

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.690
- Yes. - Yes.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.940
I,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.730
Ming Xin, Lord Chengyun of Yaoguang Mountain

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.380
and Ming Xian's younger brother,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.570
can testify before you all.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.820
This woman

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.820
is none other than Ming Xian of Yaoguang Mountain, the one who caused

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.130
your seven consecutive defeats!

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.980
What?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.730
What? How could she be Ming Xian?

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.260
Impossible!

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.660
She's clearly a fairy!

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.540
Nonsense!

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.260
- Exactly. - Yes.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.780
How can he say such nonsense with a straight face?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.610
I don't believe him.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.010
For the past 21 years,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.290
she had used the Veil of Illusion to disguise herself

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.340
as a male immortal,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.890
taking the title of Crown Prince for herself.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.730
The artifact in her hand, the Embers,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.940
was forged by Ming Xian

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.170
and answers only to her.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.890
She also wears the spiritpact bell of Ming Xian's companion beast,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.820
the White Cat.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.820
Is Fairy Ming Yi really Ming Xian?

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.980
No,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.450
it's impossible.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.380
She's a fairy. How could she be Ming Xian?

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.690
But even Ming Xian's own brother identifies her.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.940
And the companion beast

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.450
we just saw was indeed Ming Xian's cat.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.410
It can't be faked.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.380
Ming Xian, do you dare deny it?

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.450
Your identity will be exposed sooner or later.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.890
I don't believe

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.410
that after all this,

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.130
the Six Realms will still have a place for you.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.100
The Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.540
should have been me.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.610
It should have

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.930
been me.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.580
Could what he said be true?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.730
Is it true?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.980
It sounds true to me.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.370
There's no reason to make this up.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.100
- Get out! - Get out!

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.610
What are you doing?

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.250
What are you doing?

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.460
Calm down, everyone!

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.220
Step back!

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.810
Calm down, everyone!

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.580
Back up!

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.020
Do not come closer!

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.980
Stop!

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.340
Calm down!

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.100
Step back!

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.810
Stay calm! Step back!

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.410
Get out!

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.290
Back up!

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.020
Calm down, everyone!

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.410
Get out of Shouhua Academy!

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.730
- Get out! - Get out!

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.700
Ming Yi is one of us here in Shouhua Academy.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.580
You cannot drive her out just because you want to!

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.540
Ming Yi?

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.850
She's Ming Xian of Yaoguang Mountain!

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.050
- Right! - Right!

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.930
Everyone, please calm down.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:33.980
Yes, she is Ming Xian,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.140
but she's saved Jixing Abyss from disaster more than once.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.100
Have you all forgotten that?

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.340
And every artifact

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.140
used in this Qingyun Tournament

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.220
was forged by her.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.410
She has stood with us through every trial.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.900
Why are you defending her?

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.340
Why shouldn't I?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.100
When the netherbeast army struck,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.810
it was Master Ming Yi

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.220
who protected the lives of Jixing Abyss!

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.980
She was once the Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.660
If you let her stay in Shouhua Academy,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.340
aren't you afraid she'll collude with the enemy

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.490
and bring ruin upon Jixing Abyss?

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.290
That's nonsense! She would never do that!

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.780
Enough talk!

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.780
Let's rush in

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.900
and drive that traitor out of Jixing Abyss!

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.340
Drive her out of Jixing Abyss!

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.950
Calm down!

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.780
Get lost!

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.050
Master.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.780
Calm down!

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.700
Stop it!

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.900
I am Ming Xian.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.930
If anyone has grievances,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.140
come at me.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.290
Ming Xian, you traitor!

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.540
Get out of Jixing Abyss!

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.100
Get out of Shouhua Academy!

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.170
- Get out! - Get out of Jixing Abyss!

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.730
- Get lost! - Get lost!

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.700
Your Majesty, the news has already spread across all Six Realms.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.850
Fairy Ming Yi

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.780
is none other than Ming Xian, the one who caused Jixing Abyss

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.290
seven years of defeat and the loss of the Blessed Rain.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.370
Has Your Majesty been blinded by her deceit

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.610
to have allowed her to join Shouhua Academy?

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.170
Your Majesty, please seize that traitor Ming Xian at once!

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.100
Yaoguang Mountain once hailed that wretch as their Warrior God.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.290
She built her own glory

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.290
on the blood and tears Jixing Abyss offered

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.780
to Yaoguang Mountain.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.660
And now, she's even infiltrated our realm.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.250
She must have ulterior motives!

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.410
- Yes, Your Majesty. - That's right, Your Majesty.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.810
Your Majesty, we must not let her go unpunished!

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.050
Nor should we allow her to remain in Shouhua Academy!

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.140
We can't let her stay in Shouhua Academy!

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.810
- Your Majesty, you owe us an answer! - You owe us an answer!

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.700
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.410
She must not be forgiven!

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.850
- Stop hesitating, Your Majesty. - Your Majesty.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.610
- Your Majesty, make your decision now! - Your Majesty!

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.980
Give us justice!

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.900
I am indeed Ming Xian,

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.410
and it's true that I caused Jixing Abyss

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.580
to lose for seven years.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.850
But back then, I belonged to Yaoguang Mountain.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.340
There was nothing wrong

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.540
with fighting for them.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.930
Still,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.580
the hardships Jixing Abyss faces today

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.900
are partly my doing,

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.700
and I cannot just stand by.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.050
So now,

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.930
I wish to join

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.730
the warrior ranks of Shouhua Academy to fight

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.100
for the Blessed Rain that should rightfully be shared with you.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.610
Who would believe you?

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.410
What right do you have to be in Jixing Abyss?

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.810
Ming Xian would fight for Jixing Abyss?

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.900
You traitor, you lying wretch!

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:57.850
No one will believe you!

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.540
You made us lose seven years in a row,

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.810
and you dare to give this speech here?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.780
Get out of Jixing Abyss!

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.610
- Get out of Jixing Abyss! - Get out of Jixing Abyss!

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.290
- Get out of Jixing Abyss! - Get out of Jixing Abyss!

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.730
Everyone,

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.930
I know you won't believe me

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.170
no matter what I say.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.250
But there's one thing you know as well as I do:

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.410
right now, in Jixing Abyss,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.980
no one else can rival the warriors of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.780
Only I can.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.370
Without me,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.250
you will lose again, just as you did in those seven years.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.100
With me,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.490
you might still have a chance.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.930
If I truly mean to fight for Jixing Abyss,

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.850
then you'll have a chance to win,

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.420
and it will be your only chance to win.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.460
So today,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.460
I set up this arena.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.700
If anyone can defeat me,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.940
I will never again ask to join Shouhua Academy.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.420
You have so many powerful artifacts.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.300
How could we possibly beat you?

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.010
- Exactly! - Exactly!

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.060
Right.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.460
- It's impossible! - Right!

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.060
I won't use any artifacts.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.060
Everyone,

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.130
you've all seen what Ming Xian can do.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.130
She's just trying to humiliate us.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.610
That's right. She's trying to humiliate us.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.420
This is unfair!

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.250
Then I'll even fight without using my hands.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.960
What is she trying to do?

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.820
What now? Even so,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.820
no one dares to fight Master Ming Yi?

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.610
Then what are you all complaining about?

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.730
You clearly need her,

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.010
yet you still refuse to trust her.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.180
I'll give it a try.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.730
I'll fight too!

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.180
Master, you are unbeatable!

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.420
Anyone else? Come at me together.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.650
How could we ever win?

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.580
There's no way we can win.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.300
Exactly.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.130
We all know how strong you are,

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.370
but you fought for Yaoguang Mountain for so many years.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.300
How can we trust you to fight for us now?

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.180
- Exactly. - Exactly.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.770
I will vouch for her.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.770
- Greetings, Your Majesty. - Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.010
I will stake everything I have on this.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.340
Ming Yi will win back the Blessed Rain for Jixing Abyss.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.300
But...

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.530
If she ever betrays us,

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.770
then it means I've made the wrong decision.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.980
I will have her executed at once

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.650
and then abdicate the throne.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.060
What?

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.530
You are just worried

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.370
that I might collude with Yaoguang Mountain.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.700
So I will tell you the whole truth today.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.980
Though I was once Ming Xian,

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.700
my real father isn't the Emperor of Yaoguang.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.370
Nor is my birth mother the Empress of Yaoguang.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.220
My real mother was a descendant of the Bo clan of Jixing Abyss.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.060
So how am I not qualified

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.130
to fight for Jixing Abyss?

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.340
Give me this one chance,

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.820
and I will protect Jixing Abyss

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.610
so it will never again be oppressed.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:46.340
Now we can trust her.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.770
Jixing Abyss!

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.580
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:02.460
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.460
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.940
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.180
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.460
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.770
- Jixing Abyss! - Jixing Abyss!

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.650
Get out.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.300
Your Lordship, you must have heard by now.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.180
Ming Yi has renounced the Ming Xian identity

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.770
and formally joined

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.890
Jixing Abyss's Shouhua Academy.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.180
Give her up, Your Lordship!

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.940
She will be an enemy of Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.980
She already knows your true identity.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.850
And she knows of all the innocent lives

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:20.980
you have taken.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.980
You and she

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.650
can never be together!

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.980
Chao Yuan, forget her.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.220
Forget her,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.730
and you will be the one

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.460
most likely to rule Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.850
If you insist on choosing her,

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.730
you will lower yourself forever,

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.530
beneath even the dirt.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.180
Back then in Jixing Abyss,

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.340
you killed

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.130
your own brothers for her.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.730
Now you use living beings as sacrifices to train

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.250
in the art of illusory assassination.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.850
How much blood is on your hands?

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.610
Can it ever be washed clean?

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.220
She never loved you.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.180
Now that she knows what you are truly like,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.100
she could never...

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.850
Shut up!

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.100
I won't!

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.580
At first, you hesitated to kill.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.530
But now,

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.820
even when they tremble in fear,

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.650
kneel before you, and beg for mercy,

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.180
even when they die with their eyes wide open,

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.610
you don't even flinch.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.060
This is who you truly are!

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:34.850
Shut up!

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.580
Fuyue, shut up.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.580
Shut up!

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.940
I won't shut up!

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.650
Only I know this side of you.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.610
Only I grew up suffering by your side.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.010
When you had no spiritual veins and were bullied,

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.300
I was the one who endured it with you.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.820
So why do you choose Ming Yi?

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.980
Because you are not her!

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.420
Leave.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.420
Soon, I will have my own spiritual veins,

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.940
and I will no longer need you.

Fuyue,

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.420
you once took me to your Illusory Realm.

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.980
Your most precious memory

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.770
was the day I saved you from Chao Yu.

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.460
But mine was the day Ming Yi saved me.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.900
♪Let the memories be buried...♪

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.460
I will never be able to move on.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.050
But Fuyue,

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.940
you still have a chance

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.050
to live for yourself.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.810
My training has no set routine.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.090
If any of you can land even half a move on me,

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.700
that will be enough.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.860
Here in Yaoguang Mountain,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.570
we have never relied on artifacts in battle.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.940
As an Honorary Warrior,

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:44.330
shouldn't you lead by example?

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.050
We used none before

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:47.220
and still won.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:47.860
Exactly.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.900
Why do you have to use artifacts?

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.290
Yeah, we've never used any.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.380
Exactly. Why do you use them?

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.940
That kind of thinking is far too narrow.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.290
I'll show you the truth through action.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.570
If you can't overcome an artifact with your spiritual power,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.810
how will you defeat your opponents

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:10.770
in the Qingyun Tournament?

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.700
Ji Bozai,

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.460
you're doing this just to humiliate us.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.380
The former Honorary Warrior never trained us like this.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.770
Which Honorary Warrior

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.570
are you referring to?

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.730
Don't tell me you mean Ming Xin.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.220
He couldn't even train himself properly.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.900
How could he ever train you?

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.620
Why pretend not to know, Immortal Ji?

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.460
The one who trained us before

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.700
was that wretched Ming Xian.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.900
When Ming Xian brought you seven years of victory,

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.050
you hailed her as the Warrior God.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.180
Then, after a single defeat,

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.180
you turned to support Ming Xin instead,

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.420
not even sparing her a word in defense.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.380
And now, when you speak of her,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.730
you even sound full of contempt.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:53.570
How laughable.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:54.460
What,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.010
are you standing up for her now?

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.980
I bet he's doing this because they were once married,

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.570
and he came here today just to lecture us.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.810
Did Ming Xian truly train you?

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.180
How could you all be so narrow-minded?

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:08.660
You...!

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.090
I took Ming Xian's place

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.490
to lead you in the Qingyun Tournament.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.770
Everything I've said and done today

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.810
is as the Honorary Warrior.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.010
But you?

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.290
Think about what you just said.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.730
Do you still remember you are warriors?

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.570
Our time is running short.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:35.730
If you want to be worthy

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.290
of the armor you wear,

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.620
stop behaving like that.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:41.770
In this Qingyun Tournament,

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:43.660
whether you win

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.010
with spiritual power or artifacts,

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:46.660
a victory is a victory.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.620
What you should do now

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.010
is focus on getting stronger

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.730
for Yaoguang Mountain.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.770
You and Immortal Zheng Tiao are about to get married.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.810
Why are you still staying in Jixing Abyss?

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.980
I get to make battle attire

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.330
for Shouhua Academy's warriors here.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.420
I know what matters more,

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:19.700
and so does Zheng Tiao.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.900
He won't stand in my way.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:22.940
Besides,

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.860
if we saw each other every day, I might get tired of him.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:30.530
It seems Zheng Tiao and you

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.180
are quite the match.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.770
Our wedding is set for next month.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.050
But Zheng Tiao

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.860
[To the Empress of Jixing Abyss]
is a warrior from another realm.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.570
Your Majesty, could you...?

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:47.490
All right.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.860
A union between realms is a joyous event.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.770
I will issue a pass for Immortal Zheng Tiao.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.660
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.940
Looks like I'd better prepare more spirit stones

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.900
as your wedding gift.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.770
Ming Yi,

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.530
actually, I've invited someone else too.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.730
The bride and groom have arrived!

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:20.570
- Here they come! - Here they come!

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.460
She's so beautiful.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.380
First, petals for an everlasting bond!

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.900
Second, petals for love in full bloom!

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.530
Third, petals for peace through all seasons!

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.050
Fourth, petals for reunion beneath the full moon!

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.290
Fifth, petals for joy and children to bless your home!

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.420
- Yes! - Yes!

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.180
Now, the three bows.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.220
First,

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.050
bow to heaven and earth for witnessing your blessed union.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.180
Bow!

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.900
Second,

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.090
bow to your families for lasting harmony and generations of joy.

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:07.570
Bow!

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.290
- Wonderful! - Wonderful!

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.290
Bow!

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.770
- Yes! - Yes!

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:16.940
Third,

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.220
bow to each other, united in heart and soul.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.570
- Wonderful! - Wonderful!

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.380
How lovely!

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:25.980
Beautiful!

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:27.900
Lovely!

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.180
The ceremony is complete!

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.700
Zhang Tai,

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.250
marrying you

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.530
is the best thing that's ever happened to me.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.530
From now on, we can watch the stars together every night.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.090
So sweet!

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.290
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.220
What a perfect match!

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:51.250
Step aside.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.220
By His Majesty's order,

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.700
before the Diwu tree's core is fully refined,

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:54.980
Your Highness cannot leave the realm.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.290
Tell Father I hurt you.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.290
That way, Father will not blame you

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.090
for letting me escape.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.420
You truly disappoint me!

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.810
Father.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.180
Only now do I learn

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.140
of your relationship with Ming Xian

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.290
and your dealings with Ming Xin.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.090
There are plenty of things you still don't know.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.140
Such insolence!

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.250
Are you really going to kill me, Father?

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.380
If you do,

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.010
I cannot say what will happen

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.250
to the Diwu tree's core.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.810
You lowborn brat.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:59.940
You even dare to threaten me now?

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.530
Lowborn brat?

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.570
I carry your blood, Father.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.730
I've learned everything

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.810
from you, the father

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.010
I deeply admire.

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.860
If you stay here today, I will let this slide.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.330
But if you defy my order and dare to leave the realm,

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:38.250
this spell, though not deadly,

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.090
will make you suffer as if thousands of ants were gnawing at your heart.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.460
The Diwu tree's core may be your bargaining chip,

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.660
but I have my own ways to make you behave!

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.940
Think carefully

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.570
about what you should do.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.810
Congratulations, Fairy Zhang Tai.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.570
Isn't that Immortal Ji's companion beast?

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:23.530
Why is he here?

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.250
Isn't that Immortal Ji's companion beast?

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.140
What is he doing here?

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.380
Why is he here?

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.140
Yeah.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.660
Why is he here?

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.570
My lord sends this gift

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.940
to congratulate you on your wedding.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.290
Why didn't your lord come in person?

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.180
He has already severed ties with the past.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.090
Still, on hearing that an old friend is marrying,

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.570
he asked me to deliver this gift on his behalf.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.050
Please accept it.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.010
Thank you.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.250
He's leaving already?

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.980
I once overheard them talking

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.330
about something inside the Zhuojin Tower,

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.860
something called the Sky-Swallowing Array.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:15.250
Buxiu,

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:17.770
do you still remember

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.050
the portrait that burned that day?

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:31.700
A hundred years ago,

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.140
the Emperor of Zhushui laid the Sky-Swallowing Array

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.460
inside the Zhuojin Tower.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.460
He planned to seize the moment

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.420
when the Nine Heavens opened during the Qingyun Tournament

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.010
and use the array

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.420
to absorb the Blessed Rain and the primordial spirits of all beings,

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.050
claiming dominion over the Six Realms.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.250
The one who activates the array

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.810
must possess unique spiritual veins

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.900
infused with both the Heavenly Grief and the Golden Millet Dream.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:57.900
Thus, the Bo clan swore never to let the two medicines appear again.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.700
Yet now, to save my disciple, Ji Bozai,

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.180
I have to refine the Golden Millet Dream once more.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.900
I hereby record the method to undo the Sky-Swallowing Array:

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.420
Only one who has reached the Transcendent Stage

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.330
may destroy the array by sacrificing themselves

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.090
at the instant it is activated,

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.220
thereby averting catastrophe.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.660
Your Lordship...

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.860
Buxiu, there's nothing to be sad about.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.530
In all the Six Realms,

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:43.220
only I can do this.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:46.460
Besides,

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:49.810
I don't have much time left anyway.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.810
That's a good deal, isn't it?

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.770
It's just a pity

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.900
that what I promised her...

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:24.570
Today is a fine day.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.700
You came.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.900
Since you're here,

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.730
why didn't you go offer your congratulations?

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.180
Are you afraid to see me?

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.770
Maybe.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.530
Are you afraid

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.900
that seeing me would bring back painful memories

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.980
that cling like a wound to the bone?

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.660
Ming Yi.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.460
I'll go inside now.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.570
I won't disturb your peace.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:21.460
Don't catch a cold.

Let the rain decide when it's over.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.300
As long as it keeps raining,

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.090
there are no titles,

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.860
no realms,

and no Qingyun Tournament.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.130
Only you and me.

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:02.570
When the rain stops,

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:09.010

♪I'll still be your light♪

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:57.820
The rain has stopped.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.980
If only

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.300
there were a spell in this world

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.610
that could make the rain last forever.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:55.010
Ji Bozai,

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.170
take care.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.690
Immortal Ji, please wait.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.980
Fairy Zhang Tai heard you came

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.380
and asked me to deliver a gift in return.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.650
That's not necessary.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.210
She said it was something Fairy Ming Yi wanted you to have.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:23.860
Incredible, Lord Ji!

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.650
Since this pouch can hold everything,

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.260
let's call it the Qiankun Pouch.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:36.860
Come back.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.690
Why am I here?

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.650
Your Lordship!

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.780
Your Lordship.

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:15.420
Buxiu.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:17.340
Your Lordship.

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:22.900
I have already channeled my spiritual power into the Sky-Swallowing Array.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.940
My primordial spirit is now linked to it.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.010
Extract it now.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.260
If Zhushui Spiritual State activates the array,

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:35.210
remember to use my primordial spirit

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.210
to seal it at once.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:39.050
No...

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:40.210
Stop hesitating.

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:43.050
We're out of time.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:45.740
It's not over yet.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.570
Why must I take your primordial spirit now?

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.090
If I don't make it to the finals,

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.010
remember what I've told you.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.460
And do not tell Ming Yi.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.420
You... How dare you?

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.690
Your Lordship,

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.420
I will never break our spiritpact.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:14.460
This is the first time I've disobeyed you.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:16.690
Asking me to extract your primordial spirit

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:19.300
is like asking me to kill you with my own hands.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.260
I can't do it.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.340
Even if it costs me my life, I can't!

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:24.530
Buxiu...

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:26.340
We don't have to give up now.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:29.340
I will find a way to save you.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:36.940
Wait for me.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.820
Buxiu!

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.130
Your lord has treated mine heartlessly!

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.690
Step aside!

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:04.610
What are you doing here?

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:06.690
Buxiu!

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.940
- What's wrong? - Tell me...

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.820
- What's wrong, Buxiu? - why you're here first!

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.090
Why are you on your knees?

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.260
Fairy Ming Yi, I beg you, please save my lord!

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:14.570
What happened to Ji Bozai?

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:16.050
The Heavenly Grief in him has flared up again.

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:17.650
I know you can save him.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.420
Please, Fairy Ming Yi, go to Yaoguang Mountain and save him!

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:21.780
Please!

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.610
Step aside!

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.010
I don't wish to fight you.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:37.820
Ming Yi, I already let you go,

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.090
and yet you dare to return?

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.940
Please, Your Majesty, take me to see Ji Bozai.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.170
My son has nothing

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:45.860
to do with you anymore.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.130
With all these people here, this isn't the place to talk.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:50.340
Please, Your Majesty, head to the Chamber of Ease with me.
