[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.950
[Episode 4]

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.920
Here and now,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.310
no one

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.910
will meddle in your affairs.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.840
You

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.070
will die today. There's no doubt about it.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.200
I'm making this my business today,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.000
like it or not!

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.720
A traitor of Yanmen.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.070
How dare you silence a witness
right before my eyes.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.850
When those noble clans play dirty,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.979
they make my den of thieves look clean.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.300
Don't worry, Mr. Feng—

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.930
I've got your back.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.450
Cloud?

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.770
Well, well. It's your choice,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.590
but you're just

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.400
choosing your own poison.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.120
Since

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.120
you're all so eager to die,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.760
I'll make sure

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.580
you perish together today.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.320
Kill them all!

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.560
Are you alright?

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.560
What's going on?

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.400
Clearly, Jiang Qingyu

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.560
has long since bribed everyone here

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.160
to ensure Mr. Feng's demise.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.360
Our priority now

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.810
is to get out of here.

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.560
Thinking of leaving?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.590
I've gambled everything

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.990
to get this opportunity.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.470
Vice-Chief Jiang,
are you certain about this?

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.750
Once this deal is done,

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.650
you'll have nothing left.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.480
You're mistaken, Chief.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.079
If this deal succeeds,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.900
I will have everything.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.750
But this place is shrouded in thick mist—

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.810
I can't locate the gate of life at all.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.560
Indeed, the Mist Formation of Buhuan Tower

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.280
makes it

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.360
difficult to spot the gate of life
with the naked eye.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.430
However, after years

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.230
of cultivating the Yulan Sword,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.000
I can trace the flow of air

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.120
to find the gate of life—

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.520
it shouldn't be too hard.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.590
You really are both reliable and sharp.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.590
Which way do we go?

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.410
Over there.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.380
Let's move.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.480
One,

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.800
two,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.159
three.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.040
Soon, you'll

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.890
all die here.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.240
Once that happens,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.050
no one will ever trace the truth
behind Cheng's death again.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.520
Judging by the sound of the wind,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.800
the Floating Abyss

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.130
must be sinking into the depths
of the sea.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.000
Follow me—

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I'll lead you out.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.870
It's you!

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.060
Jiang Qingyu,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.680
you poisoned Jiang Cheng,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.490
all because Liu Yan manipulated you.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.890
Greed led you to invite evil
upon yourself.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.120
How pathetic.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.470
In this jianghu, power reigns supreme.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.040
Once I ascend to that position,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.920
who would dare deny

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.720
that the loyal and true-hearted
leader of Yanmen Sect

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.920
stands for righteousness?

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.450
You twist minds
and reverse cause and effect.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.380
After them!

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.920
It's Cheng's goose.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.390
Foxy Tang,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.210
what are you doing here?

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.100
And you've captured Jiang Qingyu?

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.270
Thank you, Mr. Tang, for sparing his life.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.630
This man is a key suspect wanted

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.760
by the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.670
Right now,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.390
our priority is to get out of here.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.390
Which way do we go?

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.270
Here.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.770
This way—

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.430
the exit is over here.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.870
Wait.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:58.550
Foxy Tang,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.810
we need to leave now.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.040
Indeed, Mr. Tang.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.310
This place is sinking fast.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.440
The longer we delay,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.240
the harder it will be

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.900
for even me to locate the exit.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.340
Is that so?

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.490
An exit—

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.240
or

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.100
a one-way path to the underworld?

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.070
Mr. Tang,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.980
you don't trust me?

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.150
I trust Feng Chuanxiang.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.780
But are you

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.000
really Feng Chuanxiang?

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.560
Foxy Tang!

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:48.950
Mr. Tang,

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.180
why?

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.720
It's because the real Feng Chuanxiang

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.680
has been dead

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.620
for half a year.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.270
He was killed by Jiang Cheng

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.170
on the very night
of his alleged disappearance—

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.620
slain by Jiang Cheng
in a poison-induced haze,

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.750
unable to distinguish hallucination

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.490
from reality.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.320
So that's what happened.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.870
Is that true,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.190
Mr. Feng?

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:30.330
Tang Lici,

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.000
as expected—

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.000
you are a worthy adversary of Master.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.500
Let me reintroduce myself.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.240
I am

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.080
Hua Wuyan

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.520
of the Fengliu Shop.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.840
Emissary Hua,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.150
you promised me—

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.480
if I helped you

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.510
lure Tang Lici and the others here

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.310
so you could eliminate them all,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.390
y-you would secure my position

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.030
as the leader of Yanmen Sect.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.590
You must not go back on your word.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.360
Silence!

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.590
If I may ask,

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.550
Mr. Tang,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.480
when did you first realize

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.940
I wasn't Feng Chuanxiang?

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.000
The wind brushes
through reed-covered lands;

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
the moon shatters over Mount Huaxi.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.390
Mr. Tang,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.920
pleased to meet you.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.490
I am Feng Chuanxiang.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.870
The wind brushes
through reed-covered lands;

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.720
the moon shatters over Mount Huaxi.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.720
A western sword stroke sweeps afar;

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.780
wild geese cross miles of riverbank.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.390
Mr. Tang,

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.370
is something wrong?

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.130
You didn't recognize the jade pendant,

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.910
nor did you understand the poem.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:07.600
The answer

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.480
was clear from the start.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.790
So, I gave myself away

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.520
at the very beginning, did I?

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.580
He used the Hao family massacre as bait—

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.270
first dragging Zhong Chunji's

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.600
Central Plains Sword Alliance
into the mess,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.720
then exploiting Jiang Qingyu's greed

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.280
for the Jiang Sect leadership

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.880
to stir up chaos within Yanmen.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.830
Had I failed to see through this scheme,

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.230
I would have been hunted
across the jianghu

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:28.960
and forced

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.510
to bring Chi Yun and Zhong Chunji

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.150
to the Shisan Tower

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.820
to bargain with the Chief—

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.650
there, I would have been compelled

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.910
to speak with my own lips
and reveal the secret from years past.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.120
Four years apart,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.240
and his methods remain

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.160
as clumsy as your disguise.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.670
How dare you disrespect the Master!

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.280
Did he not tell you

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.260
to flee

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.800
at the sight of me?

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.150
If you knew

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.870
I was an impostor from the start,

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.630
yet still played along

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.270
and let these baits into the pond,

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.720
it was all

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.980
to trace the Master's scheme back to him.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:35.820
Mr. Tang,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.630
have you considered

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.840
that if this move

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.240
had gone wrong,

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:41.320
their lives…

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.200
My time is precious.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.790
I have no interest

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:45.970
in wasting more words on you.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:46.720
Finding Liu Yan

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.000
is my true objective—

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.510
nothing else

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.190
matters to me.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.930
Just as the Master said—

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.080
devoid of sentiment,

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.270
driven only by cold self-interest.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:06.920
It seems

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.660
he didn't teach you

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.910
when to beg for mercy.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.570
Knowing when to beg me for mercy

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.860
would have been wise.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.240
Take me to him.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:30.720
Chi Yun.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.230
It's Liu Yan's doing.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.630
He's mine.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.480
Is that so?

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.270
Mr. Tang!

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.000
I am Cao Wufang.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:36.790
Tang Lici,

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.540
you've grown careless.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.590
A sword through the heart—

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.200
a fatal wound.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.150
Foolish.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.500
Two souls in one body—

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.000
when one dies, the other lives;

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.280
when one lives, the other dies.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.880
To think such a constitution

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.710
truly exists in this world.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.350
You think I'm a monster?

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.790
The Master said

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.460
you're a monster too.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.940
Monster against monster—

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.350
a perfect match.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.840
Mr. Tang,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.730
can monsters

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.270
even understand human emotions?

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:40.880
Go tell Liu Yan

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.840
that his petty tricks

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.700
are no match for Tang Lici.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.360
I, Tang Lici,

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.150
am second to none under heaven.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.550
If he wishes to settle our score,

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.010
let him come himself.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.530
Now get lost.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.050
Tang Lici,

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.440
if you wish to see the Master,

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.220
follow the trail of the Evil Pill.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.600
But first, you and your friends

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.370
shall enjoy this little extra gift

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.680
he prepared for you.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:29.840
What do we do?

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.700
The flames are closing in on all sides!

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.340
Foxy Tang,

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.470
stop holding back—bring out

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.790
your contingency plan now.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.990
Empty-handed as I am,

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.610
I have no contingency plan.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:40.730
Empty-handed—

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.050
Aren't you afraid
of turning into a roasted fox?

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.240
Mr. Tang,

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.230
after receiving word from Miss Shei,

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.300
I came as soon as I learned
of the situation.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.030
It seems my timing

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.440
is just right.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.200
I knew it.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.829
You cunning Foxy Tang.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:32.720
Let's go.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.400
I never expected the Vice-Chief Jiang

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.800
to be that kind of person.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.550
Right?

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.030
He always seemed

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.560
so loyal to the Sect Master.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:16.960
♪ I cross the Yan River in the wasteland ♪

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.920
His body

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.720
was completely dissolved by the poison.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.350
All I could recover was this.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:26.170
♪ Singing a long, unfinished song ♪

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.880
♪ The full moon and a few shining stars ♪

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.680
You should go—

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.570
the ceremony on their side
is about to begin.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.920
♪ Look down on my dream ♪

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.920
Go bid your master a final farewell.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.390
Master Jiang,

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.790
a year ago,

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.640
Jiang Cheng was secretly fed

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.840
the Blood Ghost Pill by Jiang Qingyu.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.200
♪ The breeze blows through the pleats ♪

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.160
He never guarded against

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.030
his own uncle

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.350
and remained completely unaware

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.510
of the poisoning.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.480
Cheng...

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.920
Then, half a year ago at Liulian Cottage,

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.110
♪ Water polishes the old ruts ♪

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.440
Feng Chuanxiang couldn't bear
to tell him the truth,

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.880
which led
to Jiang Cheng misunderstanding him.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.240
In Jiang Cheng's frenzied,
poison-induced state,

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.240
he struck out

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.270
at his closest friend

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.400
in a hallucination.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.330
Feng Chuanxiang, gravely wounded

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.280
and knowing his time was short,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.550
didn't want

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.510
Jiang Cheng to live with the guilt
of killing his friend,

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.750
so he chose

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.670
to await death alone.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.550
When Jiang Cheng

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:24.660
woke the next day,

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.420
Feng Chuanxiang had vanished.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.390
Tormented daily

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.190
by the Evil Pill,

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:29.280
♪ Destiny entwining my fleeting life,
I can't fight ♪

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.810
he spent his remaining days

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.960
searching for a truth

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.440
he could never learn—

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:34.920
until

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.410
death finally took him.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.840
Perhaps death is a mercy.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:40.910
♪ Trapped in the loop of loneliness ♪

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.570
Perhaps it's better this way.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.330
At least he never had

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.010
to face the truth
of killing his dearest friend,

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.830
nor become

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.830
a monster enslaved by the Evil Pill.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.420
You think I'm a monster?

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.890
The Master said

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:00.470
you're a monster too.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:02.550
A monster...

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.110
What?

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.700
With injuries that severe,

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.500
it'd be a miracle if he survived—

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.880
and you're saying
his wounds have already healed?

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.030
Yes, Senior,

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.720
you should go check on him.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.200
The guy Senior Fang brought back…

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.000
could he be some kind of monster?

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.360
So, the little monster's actually awake.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.590
So fierce.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.070
Fang Zhou's only talent
is picking up strays,

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.590
lunatics,

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.070
and monsters

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.270
to waste my medicine.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.400
I'll count to three,

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.030
now let go,

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:10.590
alright?

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:11.480

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.440

Are you even human?

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.300
You were really trying to kill me.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.560
You can't be killed and have no humanity…

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.850

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:55.820
♪ Shine even as I fall ♪

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:56.820
Monster!

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.980
♪ Echoes sink in silent surges ♪

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.610

♪ On the way back, a half-lit oil lamp ♪

♪ Wet ink stains surge and overflow ♪

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.440
did you turn yourself

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.680
into one as well?

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:15.330
♪ Hope what's hopeful,

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:16.240
Yan,

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:17.970
I walk the dark path—

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.240
♪ Yearn for what's yearnable,
live up to it, and never let you go ♪

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.970
that's why I don't understand.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.360
Why would a Bodhisattva

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.800
also fall into demonhood?

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.500
Is it because of me?

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.400
Mr. Tang.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:40.690
Why are you here?

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.790
You've been gone so long,

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.590
and I was worried.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.620
There's no need to do that.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.180
Wounds heal on their own.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.810
You're doing unnecessary things again.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:22.150
I've told you—

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:23.900
this is nothing

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.160
but excess to me.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.400
I don't presume to know

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.480
what you want

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.160
or don't want.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:32.920
I only know

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.250
that even if wounds heal,

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.700
they still hurt.

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.960
Mr. Tang…

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.070
are you here to mourn Young Master Jiang

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.270
and Mr. Feng?

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.160
I don't mourn

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.310
fools.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.600
There were clearly chances
to turn things around,

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.460
yet through their own stupidity,

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.210
they walked step by step

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.450
into ruin.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:06.280
You are not that kind of person,

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.410
nor do you truly think that way—

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:10.240
otherwise,

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.030
you wouldn't have helped them

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.440
find closure.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:18.640
Save your compassion.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.480
I am a monster.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.560
That is exactly
what's going through my mind,

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.530
and no one's words

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:27.190
will change that.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.790
Someone once told you

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.320
that you weren't a monster,

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.640
so I'm not

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.640
the only one

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:36.270
who sees you that way.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.480
If you can stop my wounds from healing,

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.920
then I'll believe you.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.720
But you can't—

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:58.590
which means

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:00.850
even you don't believe

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.640
the empty words

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.350
you speak.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:14.440
Do you know

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:17.200
why Liu Yan wants me dead?

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.690
It's because

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.720
I killed Fang Zhou.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:18.160
Master,

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.720
I have failed.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:20.880
I could not lure him

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.280
into our gunpowder trap.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:25.370
Master,

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.210
he was useless—

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:27.960
but I,

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.910
I even managed to stab Tang Lici.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.670
Get back.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.280
Master, I beg your forgiveness.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.880
He didn't kill you

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.350
because he wanted you back here
with a message for me.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.030
Is that it?

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.310
He said

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:49.880
these petty tricks

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:51.940
were no match for Tang Lici.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:54.920
He said his martial arts were peerless—
second to none under heaven.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.980
And if you wished to settle the score,

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.110
you had to go

00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.810
to him yourself.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.160
How ridiculous.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:04.970
He wanted me to seek him out

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.650
and even thought
that we could settle the score.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.590
Master,

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.790
shall we entrust the next phase

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.270
of the plan

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.450
to Xiaohong?

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.240
Mr. Tang,

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:19.830
Cheng...

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.440
killed Mr. Feng.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.510
A life must be repaid.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:25.900
I am willing

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.540
to sever my own arm

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.690
as atonement

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.100
to the jianghu for Cheng's crime.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.760
Master Jiang,

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:39.880
the Blood Ghost Pill

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.440
only corrupts those
already consumed by greed.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.750
An insatiable heart cannot be saved,

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.030
even by divine means.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:46.480
I will accept your arm

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.550
as atonement.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.480
But in these troubled times,

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.310
with corruption and strife everywhere,

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.240
keeping that arm

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:54.080
attached to your body

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.960
may yet serve a greater purpose.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.810
Indeed,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.000
Master Jiang.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.440
Your son was victimized by vile schemes—

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.110
the blame does not lie with him.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.790
Exactly,

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.200
there's no need to blame yourself.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.080
That's right, Jiang.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.880
The enemy's blood

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.750
stains Yanmen's maples;

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:20.030
As constant as death,

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:21.790
their crimson glows.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:22.830
From this day forward,

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:23.680
your causes

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.680
are Yanmen's causes;

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.880
those who oppose you

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:29.750
are Yanmen's enemies.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.240
Master Jiang,

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:33.990
you honor us too greatly.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.160
Thank you all.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:41.960
Take a look.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:47.310
[Under Haoyun Mountain]

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.480
Come take a look!

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.270
Try one.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.110
Excuse me.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:51.960
Make way.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:52.870
Thank you.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:53.970
Make way.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:56.110
Excuse me.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:30:59.110
Excuse me.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.110
Sorry about that.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:02.000
Excuse me.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.600
Excuse me.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.220
Make way, please.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:04.880
Is this the one?

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.240
Sir,

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.240
where's that bracelet
I was looking at the other day?

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.500
I kept it aside for you.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.510
This time I brought enough money.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.310
Is it for your love?

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:17.480
It's a gift for Zhong—

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.290
she's coming back soon.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.350
What are you doing?

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.720
Move aside!

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.790
What's wrong with you?

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:24.680
What's his deal?

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.270
M-My bracelet!

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.040
Right. It's your bracelet.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.330
Why is someone from Ranqing Sect here?

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.930
Get out!

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.640
Stop tormenting me!

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.310
How dare this person cause trouble

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.440
in a place under the jurisdiction

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.440
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance?

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.550
Central Plains Sword Alliance!

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:58.400
I need to go
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.350
To the Central Plains Sword Alliance?

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.960
Has Ranqing Sect

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.000
run into some kind of trouble?

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.830
Central Plains Sword Alliance!

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.180
Where do you come from, you monster?

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.230
Watch where you're going!

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:09.070
Monster? I'm not a monster—

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.920
you are!

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:29.700
My apologies.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.000
My Human Sword

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.510
is drawn only against villains—

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.370
I acted out of necessity just now.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:35.200
Wait,

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:36.510
I'm from Camellia Island,

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:37.700
you're from Ranqing Sect—

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.110
we're both on the side of righteousness.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.710
Let's talk this through calmly.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.560
Ranqing Sect… they're all dead.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.640
All of them!

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.350
What did you say?

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.920
All dead?

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:47.510
The entire Ranqing Sect?

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:53.200
How?

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.510
Who did it?

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:57.310
It was Tang Lici!

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.160
He sent

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.200
a demoness in red

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.400
and forced us to take large doses

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.640
of the Blood Ghost Pill…

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.840
I was the only one who…

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:56.540
Look,

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:00.680
isn't that the legendary

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.350
Master Puzhu?

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:02.810
Isn't that Master Puzhu!?

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.130
I finally get to see him in person!

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.120
Thank you, Master Puzhu.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.230
If not for you,

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:24.190
I would

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:25.630
have shamed my sect today.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:27.920
Of the Three Swords—
Heaven, Earth, and Human—

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.710
you have begun to grasp the path
of the Human Sword.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:30.570
It won't be long

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.110
before you reach the Earth Sword realm.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:33.670
Really?

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.350
Truly worthy of Master Puzhu—

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.030
such grace and composure.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.960
The killer's name

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.400
is Tang Lici.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.920
Come in.

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.840
The Hao family massacre case
has been resolved.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.480
Miss Zhong has already taken Jiang Qingyu

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.320
back to the Sword Alliance to report.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.190
Shouldn't you

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.450
also return to Yanxian now?

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.280
Yes,

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.360
Mr. Tang.

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:36.760
Whenever it's convenient along the way,

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.800
you may drop me off at any pier.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.330
Why don't you say you wish to stay?

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.420
Are you willing to let me stay?

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.800
Wasn't that

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.310
your goal all along—to stay?

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.590
The water is boiling.
I'll prepare tea for you.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.480
You are not Chi Yun,

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:11.820
not my servant.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.550
You don't have to do this.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.480
You've allowed me to stay,
even if temporarily.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.230
I have little wealth to offer,

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.550
so being able to help with small tasks

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.800
puts my heart at ease.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.030
You may look.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.050
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.280
Master Jiang,

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.030
I must return promptly
to the Sword Alliance,

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:59.490
so I'll take my leave here.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.550
The traitor Jiang Qingyu

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.480
is now in your hands, Ms. Zhong.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.360
I trust you will bring him

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.510
before the Central Plains Sword Alliance
for judgment.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.170
Yanmen Sect

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.000
will also spare no effort in assisting

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.440
the investigation
into the Blood Ghost Pill case,

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.920
pursuing it to the very end.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.520
Thank you.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.610
In that case,

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:18.290
let us each return to our duties

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:19.290
and trust to fate.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:35.710
Who is that,

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.100
arriving with such grandeur?

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.440
The Sword King has arrived.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:46.370
The Sword King?

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.590
Greetings, Sword King.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.800
-Greetings, Sword King.
-Greetings, Sword King.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.400
We were unaware of your arrival

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.190
and failed to greet you properly.

00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:59.670
Had we received word earlier,

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.360
I would have prepared a banquet

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.150
in your honor, Sword King.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:05.360
Urgent matters take precedence.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.630
I'm afraid there is no time

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:08.430
to enjoy Yanmen's hospitality.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.400
Might I ask what you mean by that,
Sword King?

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.760
The Blood Ghost Pill.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.820
Hand over the prisoner Jiang Qingyu
at once.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.600
Sword King Yu.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:24.840
No one may approach
the Sword King's presence.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.640
Master Jiang,

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.670
if you have something to say,
speak from where you stand.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:29.190
Hold it!

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.320
This is still Jiang's territory.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.630
Calling yourselves an orthodox sect,

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.160
you don't even know the simple courtesy
of a guest deferring to their host.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.920
Then do you understand
the principle of first come, first served?

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.670
If you want someone next time,

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:38.590
try waking up earlier

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:40.190
and catching them yourself.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:41.400
Who are you

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.030
to act so insolently

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:44.450
before the Sword King?

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.590
Chi Yun, the Cloud.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.110
I never expected

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:51.310
someone from the underworld

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:53.910
to meddle in the affairs
of the righteous path.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:55.070
He knows me?

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:57.670
The young master
of Yanmen consumed the Evil Pills;

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.840
Master Jiang's own brother conspired
against his nephew.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.670
A once-great sect has
not only bred traitors

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:03.550
but also colluded with underworld figures.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:04.920
To see Yanmen fall so low

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.550
is truly disheartening.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.680
Sword King Yu,

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.770
this individual

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.990
has already been handed over

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.590
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance
for judgment.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:13.520
That's correct,

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.850
Sword King.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.360
I am Zhong Chunji,

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.150
Branch Chief of the Shanfeng Branch,
Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:22.800
Taking the prisoner Jiang Qingyu
into custody

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.480
is under the direct order of my master.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.360
I ask for your understanding, Sword King.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.960
You wield Little Peach Blossom,

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.150
the seventh-ranked dagger
on the Roll of Renowned Blades.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:32.480
You are Shao Yanping's beloved disciple.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.140
Young lady,

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:34.990
how is your master doing?

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.440
My master is well.

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:38.510
Thank you for your concern, Sword King.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:39.440
But did you know?

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.760
Even if your master were here today,

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.240
he would not dare stand in my way.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.690
Sword One, Sword Two—seize the prisoner.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.190
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.520
Wait!

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.410
From the sound of it,

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.280
you believe whoever has the strongest fist
makes the rules. Is that it?

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.630
The Sword King City has always
upheld virtue to persuade

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.760
and martial prowess to eradicate evil.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.400
Do you dare obstruct me?

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.090
Look how full of yourself you are.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:04.280
I'll stand right here
and take one strike from you—

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.340
you still won't so much as scratch me.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:08.360
Mr. Chi.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.600
Chi Yun, have you lost your mind?

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.280
Well, you scum.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.280
Do you dare or not?

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.880
If I take even one step back,
you can take him—

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.030
I won't say a word.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:17.960
But if you can't hurt me,

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.510
take your pretty-boy entourage

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:20.240
and get lost.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.840
Even Master Puzhu

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.000
would not dare utter such insolent words.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:28.070
Enough nonsense—
do you take the bet or not?

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:29.320
Afraid I'll bully you?

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.710
I'll even turn my back—

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:31.650
dare you try?

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:41.510
Sword King Yu,

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.150
Chi Yun is just speaking out of anger.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.080
Yes, Sword King.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:45.460
He—

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:46.380
Very well.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:02.380
I accept it.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.190
Chi Yun.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.320
Foxy Tang.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:42.230
I knew it—

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.550
every time I'm about to have my moment,

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.480
you show up to steal the spotlight.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.220
Foxy Tang,

00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:59.550
I bet him I wouldn't take
a single step back.
