The dog that bit from the back
and sent a gunman to shoot Pheem.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.460
Dad, if you agree to work with Jason,

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.190
the company I'm holding shares in
will give you the fund you need right now.

Do you think I'd see you as a hero?

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.820
I have no intention of being a hero, Dad.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.500
Heroes are bland and boring.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.060
Dad, as you know,

I aspire to be your successor,
namely the next ruler of Thanavej.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.420
Plus, you did tell me

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.860

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.020
Ha-ha.

Don't you think I know about him?

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.420
Dad, is it your wish to turn the hospital
into Chet's drug dealing center?

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.100
Huh?

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.180

But the the joint lawsuit
filed by the investors

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.220
Take my suggestion,

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.860
or the reputation of Thanavej,
which you love dearly,

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.460

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:49.980
Dad,

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.700
you don't have many choices now.

-He'll ruin what we have!
-Did I ask for your opinion?

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.380
Dad, you've made
the right decision for Thanavej.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.460
The credit goes to you, Risa.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.660
Thank you for taking my advice
and arranging a meeting for me and Dad.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.430
I'll make you
the representative of Thanavej

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.800
in charge of coordinating
the cooperation with Jason Lee.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.460
Thank you very much, Dad.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.140
Chairman,

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.780
are you sure of letting Pheem come back?

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.860
Pheem is my son, Danai.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.660
What reason do I have to trust him?

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.460
Pheem!

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.660
I know you brought Jason in
only to fight for the reign over Thanavej!

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.920
Are you trying to destroy Thanavej, huh?

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.400
Why would I do that, Brother Chet?

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.060
Now, Thanavej is about to become mine.

you're worried about the hospital.

at the sex party, weren't you?

What awaits me, Chet?

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.620
Oh. Are you going to
send someone to kill me again?

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.380

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.340

the killing of Senator Surasak?

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.270
Hey, Brother, stop slandering me.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.360
I know nothing about that matter.

Don't make accusations without proof.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.480
Pheem promised to personally investigate
Senator Surasak's incident.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.780
Investigate?

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.460
So you do believe him, Than?

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.819

he was behind that whole thing.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.420
I feel terribly sorry for you.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.660
Pheem will ditch you
when you have no use for him anymore,

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:17.780

an exhausted and useless plough ox to...

I discovered from the CCTV footage

that they switched to another car
and drove to Salaya.

Good.

It's not hard to track them
since the scope has been narrowed down.

Hey, Than.

There's one more thing.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.580
A new chief has been transferred
to the police office.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.580
He seems nice and upright.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.100
He said he'd conduct a thorough clean-up
in the police system.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.620
Sounds great.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.580
Oh. What is it with you, Than?

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.340
I told him what happened to you.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.780
He said
if you could prove you were innocent

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.500
of taking bribes in the Fentanyl case,

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.180
then you could be a cop again.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.060
Is that true, Phaen?

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.260
Of course it's true!

Wut the pharmacy manager.

We must go find him now.

to get off the hook this time.

Let's discuss it today.

I want to know the findings of Tanavej's
previous investigation on Chet.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.820
Phaen said if I could shake off Chet's
false accusation of me taking bribes,

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.420
I could go back to being a cop.

Pheem and you are mistresses' children.
You're just a team of bums.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.270
You think you can cause harm to me, huh?

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.940
But even bums like us

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.060
can back you into a corner, you worse bum.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.460
Risa, how dare you talk to me like that?

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.020
What do I have to fear?

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:34.060
In 3 days, we'll sign a contract
about the health center with Jason.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.160
Pheem will come back
to take over the project

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.660
and the entire Thanavej Hospital from Dad.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.740
Risa,

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:42.500
you...

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.580
Pheem will probably get you

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.470
out of the picture when he returns.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.340
I'm really curious
about how he'll do that.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.200
Will it be as satisfying as I imagine?

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.880
Why are you still standing there?

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.300
Haven't you got your coffee already?

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.100
It helps you see things clearly.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:31.660
Mr. Chet.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.740
No, Mr. Chet!

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.940
-I need an injection now. Park, let go!
-No!

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:35.780
Don't do this!

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.460
I'm falling apart, Park.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.220
-Let go!
-No!

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:37.900
Let go of me!

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:38.420
Chet!

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.220
Let go!

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:40.420
Park!

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.980
Ah. Let go!

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:42.660
No way.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.480
Mr. Chet, listen to me.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.790
We've taken care of everything

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.510
and placed Wut in a hideout.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.420
Mr. Chet, you can't do this.
This is too risky.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.980
What if someone sees you?

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.260
Darn it!

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.550
Why do you have to be a buzzkill?

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.660
I'm scared.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.660
If Pheem gets everything,

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.100
what should I do?

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.540
Don't worry, Mr. Chet.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.260
I'll absolutely not let that happen.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.900
Wait! It's me.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:44.940
Calm down.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.660
Hear me out.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:51.500
I'm sorry.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:57.740
On the day you left, I invited Jason over
for a talk about the cooperation contract.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.780
I know.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.980
I also knew from the beginning

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.580
that you didn't need Wut back
for the drug case.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.060
Nothing you've done is for justice.

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.940
You only care about your own interests.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.660
Are you using me?

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.100
That's not true.
You're taking it wrong, Than.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.780
I genuinely want to help you.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.110
Pheem, I'm trying my best to trust you.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.500
But all you can think about
is your father and Chet.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.360
Nothing's in your mind but what you can do
to get back to Thanavej and win Chet.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.340
What about me, Pheem?

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:10.900
Wait, Than!

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.020
You have to trust me.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.280
They found out about the assassination.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.580
This must be Chet's doing again.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.710
Go downstairs and find a place to hide.
Hurry!

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.180
Hide behind the door. I'll deal with him.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.080
But what about you?

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.420
Just go!

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.900
Darn it.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.420
Oh!

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.940
Ouch!

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.580
Are you okay?

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.740
Drop the gun.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.030
I'm telling you to drop the gun!

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.620
Mr. Thanet needs to see you guys now.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.300
Park!

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.100
Dad.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.070
I asked him to do it.
Hold me accountable instead.

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.700
Hold you accountable,

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:01.980
huh?

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:02.740
Mr Chet!

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.900
Chairman, please don't...

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:15.340
When Pheem was away from Thanavej,

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.420
I wouldn't care if you were to kill him
or do anything to him.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.620
But now, he is helping me with my project.

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:25.860
I won't let anyone lay a finger on Pheem!

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.580
Violate that,

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.420
and I'll make you two pay a steep price.
Bear it in mind!

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.139
Brother, your little lapdog

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.260
is quite fun.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.780
Hey, Pheem!

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.460
-Mr. Chet...
-Don't.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.100
Stop it.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.660
Are you okay, Mr. Chet?

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.940
-Are you alright?
-I'm all fine.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.060
You're seated here, treating my wound.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.960
It means you're not mad at me anymore,
right?

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:02.940
Hey, you...

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:05.460
Are you still mad at me?

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.350
What do I have to do
to keep your anger at bay, Than?

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.420
Tell me.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.780
What can I do to make you feel better?

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:20.780
Pheem.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.400
I'm different from Parkphum.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:29.460
I'm not your lapdog. You can't make me
wag my tail or pick up a ball.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:33.430
You can't do whatever you want to me
or expect me to let you walk on me.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.460
Than...

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.020
I'm only doing my job as your bodyguard.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.260
I'm done with following you around
and being fooled by you.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.910
From now on,
we'll only talk about work-related issues.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.620
Hey.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.140
Fetch me something from the room.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.540
You said we'd only talk about work.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.840
This is a work-related issue.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.140
What are you asking for?

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.700
The black box in the cabinet.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.460
Open it.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.780
The red one too.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:53.060
Just call me "Thunder Man." Biu!

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:57.020
The Thunder Man has such a ring.
He transforms with it on.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:04.300
Can you be my playdate forever?

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.140
Of course.
I'll go wherever you go.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:08.940
You promise?

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.220
I promise.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.180
Why do you have this ring?

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.940
It's just a toy ring.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.820
Someone important gave it to me
when I was little.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.780
When I was feeling weak,

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.900
he helped me lead

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.860
an ordinary kid's life for some time.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.780
It was a short while, though.

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.420
He was quite a dork,

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.420
thinking of himself as the Thunder Cop.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.460
Are you Team?

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.560
Why didn't you tell me at the first place?

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.540
Did you take me as a clown?

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.860
No, Than.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.460
I meant to tell you the truth.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.820
But look at me now, Than.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.780
I've become a heartless man.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.900
All I can think about is revenge.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.140
I'm no lolnger the Pheem
that you met in childhood.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:43.980
I was afraid.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:49.400
I was afraid that you'd hate me
after learning about the truth.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.980
I didn't want you to hate me.

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.500
You don't hate me, do you?

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.320
You're different from Parkphum.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.540
You're very important to me.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.420
That's why I want you by my side.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.620
You promised

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.580
to fight the bad guys for me,

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.140
to take care of me, and to protect me.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.540
You must keep your promise.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.940
Don't leave me behind, Than.

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.020
Mom, don't worry.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.820
I won't let Pheem

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.140
take everything away from me.

[Thanavej Hospital]

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.020
Let go of me!

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.980
Calm down. Calm down.

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.460
-Calm down.
-Help!

00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.300
Let go of me!

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.220
Is this

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.140
what I have to know, as you said?

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.620
The reason that I'd cancel the contract?

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:09.150
Veerin used to own
an electronic parts manufacturing company.

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.020
Then, Jason invested in her corporation,

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:16.660
and suggested her expand her business
and apply for more loans.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:21.020
When there was zero liquidity left
in her company, he bought all its shares.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.230
And that makes you think

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.580
I'd make

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.140
a mistake like this woman did?

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:27.860
Dad,

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.060
I know you're a seasoned businessman.

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.940
But Jason has Pheem's support now.

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:37.460
He might've learned of
Thanavej's internal affairs from Pheem.

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.680
Can you just give me some time?

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.900
I'm negotiating
with my mother's relatives.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:49.220
The funds we can get from them
won't be less than those from Jason.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:57.900
Mr. Chet,

00:45:58.300 --> 00:45:59.660
a call from Mr. Jenpop.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:03.780
Hello.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.420
Really?

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:09.500
Keep me updated.

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.700
Dad, Uncle Jenpop just called

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.500
and told me his selling his land in Samui.

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.260
Once it's sold,

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:22.380
he'll invest all that money
in our health center.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.040
What did you say happened?

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.980
Pheem, I found out
why Dad wouldn't sign the contract.

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:50.510
It really was Chet's doing.

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:53.140
Mr. Chet told Mr. Thanet

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.500
how Mr. Jason tricked Ms. Veerin

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.420
and made her go insane.

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.480
Someone went insane due to his scams?

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.580
I think you should stay away from Jason.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.340
Chet is looking for new investors now.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:13.620
What should we do?

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.660
[Thanavej Hospital]

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.780
Dad, I know someone
has disturbed your mind with some stories.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.580
That's why you're postponing
signing the contract.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:29.540
But you have to trust me.
I have my own plans.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.460
It seems Chet has made a pact
with his mother's relatives.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:39.590
The business partner you introduced
comes from a complex background.

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:41.900
If I get to choose,

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.460
I'll definitely opt for
a less risky option.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.140
But Chet was involved
in the Fentanyl case, Dad.

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.620
He really did wrong.

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.100
No matter what, Chet is still my son.

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:55.100
I raised him myself.

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:58.780
For me,
it's easier to deal with him than Jason.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:21.380
I heard your father planned to defer
the signing of the contract.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.460
Sounds like he's wobbling, Pheem.

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:25.940
As it happens,
Chet has just caused some trouble.

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.980
Things aren't looking good if your brother

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:30.460
stays in the way.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.260
What a conniving man Chet is.

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.060
What are we going to do, Pheem?

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.460
At this rate,
our plan will end up a failure.

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:45.000
We'll have to
use the Fentanyl case against him.

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.140
But I remember what you said before.

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:50.100
Dad knew
Chet was the culprit of the Fentanyl case,

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:51.760
yet he still took Chet's side.

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:53.580
Wut can still be of help to us.

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.940
He knows all of Chet's secrets.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.940
We have to find Wut,

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.740
and make him confess
that Chet was the mastermind.

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.030
Then, we can proceed with our plan.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:07.020
It won't work.
Dad won't pick either of us anyway.

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.460
Why won't it work, Risa?

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.300
I'll push Dad to make a choice
between saving Chet

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.560
and keeping Thanavej from destruction.

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.380
What do you mean?

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:20.160
If Dad is still partial to Chet
when we have Wut's video,

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:23.300
I'll release all the evidence I have,

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.760
let it go to the news,
and have Chet arrested.

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:28.380
I'd like to know which Dad will choose

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.180
in that case, his oldest son,

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.260
or his precious Thanavej Hospital.

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:37.260
But if we go down that path,
Thanavej will be ruined.

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.780
If I can't have Thanaver,

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.740
then no one else can have it.

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:50.720
But the problem
is we don't know where Wut is.

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:03.820
Someone did see a man resembling Wut.

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:06.060
I'll let you know

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:07.870
if I have more findings.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.780
Than,
how's the investigation on Wut going?

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.270
Why are you suddenly asking about Wut?

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.600
How was it sudden?
I've been working on this matter too.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.320
I was a bit busy some time ago, though.

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:30.020
Come with me.

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.380
Come on.

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:39.500
You must find Wut,
as he can testify for your innocence,

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.460
and help you get back to being a cop.

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:47.060
I'd never forget my promise to you,
would I,

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.140
Than?

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:53.820
The recent finding says
Wut has gone to Salaya.

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:55.950
What have you got following this lead?

00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:00.620
I did my best to try tracking him down,
but the local police wouldn't help me.

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.620
They said this wasn't an official case.

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:05.780
Pretty bleek.

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.830
What's there to do then, Pheem?

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:18.540
Risa, where are you?

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.140
I got some news.

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:30.020
I found Wut.

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.780
Good.
Then we can make him testify against Chet.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.960
This time,
we'll definitely take down Chet.

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:38.460
Let's go.

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.380
Mr. Chet,

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.480
they know where Wut is now.

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:54.220
Okay. Got it.

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:01.460
Take him away.

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.660
Mr. Chet, where are you taking me?

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.540
I-I didn't go out to see anyone.

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.540
I did everything as you said.

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:10.800
I'm sorry for the trouble
you'll have to go through.

00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:14.180
I want to go home to my wife and child.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:20.300
Don't worry about your family.

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:24.380
I'll transfer money to them every month.
I'll take good care of them.

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.300
Take him away.

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:27.940
Mr. Chet!

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:28.580
Come here.

00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:29.340
Come with me!

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.060
Mr. Chet!

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:31.740
-I didn't do anything!
-Come!

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:33.740
-I didn't do anything!
-Come!

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:34.500
Mr. Chet!

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:35.540
-Mr. Chet!
-Come with me!

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:36.180
Mr. Chet!

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:37.860
I didn't tell anyone anything!

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:39.180
Spare me, Mr. Chet!

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:39.780
Shut up!

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:40.910
-Mr. Chet!
-Shut up!

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.420
-You can't do this to me, Mr. Chet!
-Pheem?

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.620
Thank you for leading the way,
Brother Chet.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:47.080
They know where Wut is now.

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.740
Okay. Got it.

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:56.740
It's done. Everything's going planned.

00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:58.460
Than, bring him over.

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:28.420
Park, go get rid of him!

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:29.460
Go!

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.460
Hey!

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.100
I promised
[In the Next Episode]

00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:43.660
to be your friend
and to protect you forever.

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:48.860
Maybe he has misled you
to think you're his whole world.

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:51.060
But in fact, you're just a lapdog to him.

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:55.780
Do whatever you want,
as long as Thanavej won't be affected.

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:57.100
Proceed as planned.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:58.860
Hey!

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.260
You still don't realize it?

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:05.780
Surasak and Wut were both killed by Pheem.

00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.880
You didn't know that, did you?
