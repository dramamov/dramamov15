(I've Come to Take Your Life
for Consort Wan)

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.664
(Yongxiu Palace)

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.120
You're insane.
Did Consort Jing send you?

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.940
I've come to take your life
for Consort Wan!

00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:43.820
You're truly insane.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.300
Every debt has its creditor.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.060
This is what you deserve.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.100
I'm still a court woman.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.500
If I die,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.500
you'll also be punished.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.580
I don't care at all.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.340
Right now,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.700
you're nothing but prey.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.460
I'll torment you to death slowly.

00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:17.920
(Chengxi Palace)

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.300
I'm here, Your Majesty.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.460
Didn't you say you want to dine with me?

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.580
Your Majesty,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.780
are you hungry?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.060
Any suggestions, my love?

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.940
I've dismissed all the servants

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.060
from the palace.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.060
Your Majesty, look at my chamber,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.460
this bed,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.860
and this space.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.500
Is it spacious enough?

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.708
Eat.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.620
This is leftover food, right?

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.668
Take it away.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.460
Don't starve yourself
and get me into it.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.940
What a jinx!

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.960
Say that again.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.020
Jinx!

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.860
What can you do if I say it again?

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.100
How dare you hit me?

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.660
You...

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.652
Stop.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.060
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.660
Ling Yun,

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.700
I was waiting for your comeback.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.260
I never thought you can't
even handle a lowly servant.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.300
How utterly boring.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.660
Your Ladyship,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.500
Ling Yun sure loves putting on airs.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.260
Even under house arrest,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.740
she still acts like a master.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.900
She just said the food was awful
and smashed the bowl.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.140
You lowly one daring to defy masters!

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.380
She once served His Majesty,

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.260
while you're just a lowly servant.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.060
It's not your place to speak.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.860
Kneel outside all night.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.620
Madam Jiang was planted by Consort Jing.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.780
I don't want you dead too soon.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.300
Understood?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.196
Don't worry.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.700
I'll stay alive.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.904
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.660
After all, you once served her.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.060
Visit her at Yongxiu Palace sometimes

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.756
and bring her some food.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.388
Yes.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.460
Your Highness,
you've got the kindest heart.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.580
Don't let her starve to death.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.860
Her life

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.220
is still of use to me.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.340
Forgive my boldness,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.740
but without her rank,

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.144
of what use can she be?

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.900
Consort Jing hasn't fallen yet.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.020
Everything is uncertain.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.660
Shall we dispose

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.816
of Madam Jiang?

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.904
Keep her.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.060
No need to make
Ling Yun's life comfortable.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.384
Understood.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.780
Only half a bowl of rice gruel daily.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.500
Let me see how long you can last.

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.912
(Chengxi Palace)

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.820
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.020
May I ask

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.264
why you summoned me?

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.640
Hmm.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.380
In your opinion,

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.460
given the current palace situation,

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.260
can Ling Yun still survive?

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.792
In this imperial harem,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.380
only His Majesty decides life or death.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.860
As you said,

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.300
Ling Yun is still His Majesty's woman.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.820
Do you know

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.900
whether His Majesty
ignores her deliberately

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.060
to make her

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.020
give in to him and beg for mercy?

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.540
Your Ladyship,
why are you telling me this?

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.860
Ling Yun holds no power now.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.620
She poses no threat to you.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.104
True.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.700
Even if she regains favor,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.180
it'll be her last gasp.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.380
She once used His Majesty's affection
to deal with Consort Wan.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.500
His Majesty holds pride.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.900
He'll never tolerate
impure affection from others.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.820
You're perceptive.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.100
My next target

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.540
will be the lofty Consort Jing.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.456
Chief Wu,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.940
should we collaborate?

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.580
You jest.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.340
I serve His Majesty

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.860
and should attend to the ladies
of the harem and ease their troubles.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.220
How could we collaborate?

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.500
Your recent actions

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.660
have spread unease
in the imperial harem.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.140
Yet this was all for His Majesty?

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.140
If you have no further matters,

00:06:53.472 --> 00:06:54.540
I

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.460
will take my leave.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.660
Jian.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.940
Yes.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.260
I heard Ling Yun has fallen ill,

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.700
only drinking rice gruel.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.700
Fetch medicine
from the Medical Bureau for her.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.140
Don't let her die.

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:18.048
Yes.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.984
Your Highness,

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.940
there's report from Chengxi Palace.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.260
As you predicted,

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.560
Noble Lady Mu

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.700
indeed sought to collaborate
with Chief Wu.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.260
Did he agree?

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.104
He wouldn't dare.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.740
Everything remains under your control.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.700
One more matter, Your Highness.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.860
It's said that Ling Yun

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.340
has been bedridden
from Madam Jiang's torment.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.820
She's still alive?

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.020
Madam Jiang said

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.820
Ling Yun was nearly dead.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.700
But someone

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.420
sent her medicine.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.300
Whose else could it be?

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.460
Wu Linfu is still protecting her?

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.816
Your Highness,

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.860
I suspect Noble Lady Mu sent it.

00:08:08.992 --> 00:08:09.952
Right.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.424
It was her.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.340
It should be her.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.100
Noble Lady Mu grows more favored.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.300
Yesterday, she enjoyed music
and wine in the Imperial Garden.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.980
And today, she stages operas
in the palace.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.380
Such a born seductress.

00:08:28.768 --> 00:08:29.740
Now,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.180
she meddles with Ling Yun's affairs.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.660
Who does she think she is?

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.580
Does she mean to overturn
the order here?

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.460
She's arrogant from favor,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.540
but she wouldn't dare disregard you.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.740
Why would I care for her regard?

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.340
She can vie for favor,

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.300
but she'll never surpass me
to become the new empress.

00:08:51.648 --> 00:08:52.704
Yes.

00:08:52.704 --> 00:08:53.568
(Section Five: Seeing the Reality)
Yes.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.300
I want her dead.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.700
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.540
Please rise.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.580
The weather has turned cold lately.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.540
Why do you still dress so lightly?

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.300
You should wear more layers

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.480
and mind your health.

00:09:17.088 --> 00:09:18.048
Lv He.

00:09:18.048 --> 00:09:18.980
Yes.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.580
Fetch some warm milk.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.368
Yes.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.180
Thank you for your concern. Might I ask

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.020
why you

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.460
summoned me?

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.100
How is the task

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.540
I assigned you?

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.224
Don't worry.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.500
I've been diligent in my efforts.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.488
Good.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:59.840
Thank you.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.340
Have you visited
the Medical Bureau recently?

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.980
Basking in your favor,

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.460
I enjoy perfect health.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:08.780
I haven't been there.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.580
Then why do I hear

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.660
Ling Yun got life-saving medicine
from the Medical Bureau?

00:10:16.192 --> 00:10:17.184
Medicine?

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.240
What medicine?

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.780
Why did she need medicine?

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.300
Wu Linfu,

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.380
did you provide her medicine?

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.504
Your Highness,

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.140
I didn't give her the medicine.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.740
But Ling Yun mustn't die.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.496
She

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.700
may still serve
as a useful pawn for you.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.860
I act in your interest.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.660
Whether Ling Yun becomes my pawn or not
is not my main concern.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.580
What matters to me is your attitude.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.620
You must be aware

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.020
you belong to me.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.140
Since you belong to me,

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.340
you should adapt to circumstances

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.460
and only devote to me.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.580
But if you dare betray me,

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.220
this will be Ling Yun's fate.
