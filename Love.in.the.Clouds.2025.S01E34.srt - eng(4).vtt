00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.100
You still haven't explained why you must see Ji Bozai.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.660
How do I know you will not harm him?

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.020
I know that, because of my current identity,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.900
it is hard for Your Majesty to trust me.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.100
But if I wished to harm Ji Bozai,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.620
I've had hundreds of chances to do it.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.050
Why would I wait until now?

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.770
Your Majesty, please let Fairy Ming Yi in.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.570
His Lordship's spiritual veins are shattered,

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.930
and his pulse is faint.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.850
His spiritual veins are shattered?

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.490
Your Majesty,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.620
right now, I'm the only one who can save your Crown Prince.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.000
You must let me see him.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.170
Ji Bozai promised me

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.340
that he had cut ties with his past.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.340
That's why I agreed not to punish you for your crimes.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.610
After this,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.890
don't come to Yaoguang Mountain again.

- Understood. - Understood.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.140
Back then, because of the absence of the Diwu tree's core,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.770
the Golden Millet Dream that my lord took was incomplete.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.090
It could only suppress the poison temporarily,

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.860
and there was always a risk of relapse.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.650
Before she died,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.210
Fairy Bo refined a complete Golden Millet Dream.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.610
But my lord refused to take it.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.650
He used it as bait

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.050
to draw out his enemies.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.090
He's suffering a relapse now

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.810
because he burned through his spiritual power

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.760
to refine the Golden Millet Dream again.

Not only did he exhaust his spiritual power, but he also

forced open his Spirit Well to save you.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.260

Why would you use your heart's blood?

Ming Yi,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.900
how much of it do you even have to give before it drains you dry?

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.620
So what?

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.700
Have you ever thought

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.210
about how it feels for me to see you like this?

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.020
You knew you would relapse,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.700
yet you still gave me the Golden Millet Dream.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.770
You never told me. I didn't know a thing.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.260
I just received my master's reply.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.700
He said he still hadn't found the Diwu tree's core.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.500
What am I supposed to use to save you?

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.530
You know that without the Diwu tree's core,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.090
even with the recipe,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.770
the Golden Millet Dream can't be made.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.970
So why risk your life doing this?

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.770
Shut up.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.530

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.940

Ji Bozai,

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.170
I used to think

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.850
that in this life,

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.410
I'd always be trapped

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.580
in the name of Ming Xian,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.020
never able to be myself

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.170
or know

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.020
how it felt to love someone.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.620

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.850
because of you,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.020
everything changed.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.090
So don't hide everything from me

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.500
and make me...

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.020
make me stand by and watch you die.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.210
I won't let that happen.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.700
Enough.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.900
Ming Yi,

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.650
you've already done more than enough.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.060
I thought I'd never see you again.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.620
Ji Bozai.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.530
There, there.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.940
I'm fine now.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.900
Did you really think

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.730
I'd just sit by and watch you make the Golden Millet Dream?

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.140
If you want it,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.290
take it.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.580
Don't play tricks on me.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.770
You used a winged leech against Ji Bozai

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.740
to trigger a relapse of the Heavenly Grief?

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.530
I truly underestimated you before.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:07.740
But tell me, Chao Yuan,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.140
why would someone as cautious as Ji Bozai

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.100
let you get close to him so easily?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:12.900
Father,

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.290
everyone has a weakness.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.450
And Ji Bozai's weakness

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:20.810
is love.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.650
Love?

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.140
Who could he possibly love?

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.620
Don't tell me it's Ming Xian.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.260
The upheaval at Yaoguang Mountain

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.810
is no secret to anyone.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.100
Ming Xian usurped

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.220
Ji Bozai's title and power,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.620
and yet he ended up falling in love with her?

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.500
How utterly laughable.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.650
Indeed, Father.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.450
In your eyes,

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.930
all emotions must seem laughable.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:01.530
What,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.050
are you displeased with me?

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.140
I would never dare.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.810
You have lived for over a century

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.020
and witnessed the rise and fall of countless things.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.220
Naturally, nothing moves you anymore.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.020
Someone like me could never

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.410
compare to even a fraction of your insight or cultivation.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.650
Now, hand over the Diwu tree at once.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.100
Once I make the Golden Millet Dream,

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.170
you shall have your share,

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.770
and you will finally have what you've always wanted:

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.930
spiritual veins of your own.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.810
Since I've accomplished

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.450
such a great task for you, Father,

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.140
could you reward me with the title of Crown Prince?

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.020
Insolent!

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.770
So you meant to bargain with me all along?

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.690
Hand over the Diwu tree now!

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.220
Unfortunately,

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.340
I've already planted it in my heart.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.170
If you want it...

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.530
Father,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.740
if you had hesitated for even a moment,

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.140
just one moment,

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.290
I would not have done this to you.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:47.380
You... you are just like that woman.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.140
You both betrayed me.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.930
The Golden Millet Dream is already within me,

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.050
and Chao Yan is dead.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.930
I am the only son you have left.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:16.650
It is time

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.900
you told me how you really plan to seize control

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.340
of the Six Realms.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.810
You wretch.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.650
If you tell me everything, Father,

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.530
I will

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.170
spare your life.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.290
Fine. I will tell you.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.020
I once foolishly believed

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.740
that I could share my ambitions

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.980
[A hundred years ago]
with the one I loved,

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.530
and that we could rule the Six Realms together.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.220
However...

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.100
Your Majesty, you promised me

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.860
that you would form the Heartbond Array with me.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.770
What exactly is this Heartbond Array?

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.980
It can enhance the power of the netherbeasts, of course.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.740
You know

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.170
I would never do anything that could harm you.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.290
She... she lied to me.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.930
The Heartbond Array sealed the netherbeasts.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.340
I truly cared for her,

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:40.380
but she betrayed me

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.530
and ruined my grand plan.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.410
You lied to me.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.450
You and I should both go to hell together.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.170
Lin Ziyao,

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:18.860
even without the netherbeast army,

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.860
I still have the Sky-Swallowing Array.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.930
You have already reached the Perfected Stage.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.340
By sacrificing you

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.930
and combining that with the Heavenly Grief and the Golden Millet Dream,

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.020
I will be able to activate the array,

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.530
seize all the Blessed Rain of the Six Realms,

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.650
and rule them all!

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.900
Now you see, Chao Yuan,

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.970
how foolish I once was.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.930
To achieve true dominion,

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:09.660
one must cast aside all emotion.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.990
Father, you can rest now.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.920
I will not take your life.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:32.300
I finally understand

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.100
[Divine Crimson Palace]
why you became who you are now.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.070
But I am not like you.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.580
Emotion does not make me weak.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.440
It only makes me stronger.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.640
In celebration of Prince Chao Yuan's appointment as Crown Prince,

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.890
Zhushui Spiritual State will exhibit

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.000
the long-lost treasure of the Six Realms, the Diwu tree, at the Zhushui Palace.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.890
This announcement is to be shared across Hexu.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.200
Ming Yi!

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:20.680
What are you doing here?

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:22.960
Buxiu and Twenty-Seven sent me a message.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.640
They...

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.160
Wait, what's wrong? You look pale.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:26.920
I'm fine.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.090
I just got word

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.800
that the Diwu tree is in Chao Yuan's hands.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.290
I'm going to Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.890
You mustn't go!

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.520
That boy is setting a trap for you.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:35.560
That little brat.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.280
Even back when he was Situ Ling,

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.280
he had already tricked me into revealing too much.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.080
He knows

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.480
the final catalyst herb for the Golden Millet Dream is the Diwu tree.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.720
But I am clearly his target.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.930
Even if it's a trap, even if it's a deadly one,

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:47.850
I have to go.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.480
As expected, it's fake.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.650
Should I call you Situ Ling

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.320
or Chao Yuan?

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.760
You can call me whatever you like.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.480
I don't think you ever wanted

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.760
to return to Zhushui Spiritual State as its prince.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.480
What made you decide to become Chao Yuan again

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:16.890
and abandon your life as Situ Ling?

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.320
Ming Yi,

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.480
as soon as Ji Bozai's life was in danger,

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.720
I spread word across the Six Realms

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.130
that the Diwu tree was in my possession.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.520
You're clever.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.720
You must have realized

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.410
that his relapse was my doing,

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.560
and that the Diwu tree

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.690
was the bait I set for you.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.040
You knew there would be a trap,

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.320
but you still came.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.320
For him,

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.320
you would really risk everything,

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.280
even knowing you're walking straight into a trap, wouldn't you?

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.890
Chao Yuan,

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.130
why don't you just tell me

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.930
what I have to do to get the Diwu tree's core?

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:28.170
Don't you already know

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.280
what I want from you?

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.800
Ming Yi,

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.000
this is the wedding gown I prepared for you.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:29.560
Chao Yuan,

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.320
you're a Crown Prince now.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:33.930
You've captured me,

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.930
yet instead of eliminating a powerful rival for your father

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.970
before the Qingyun Tournament,

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.130
you're holding a ridiculous wedding?

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:42.130
Yes.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.720
Compared to eliminating a rival

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:47.520
before the Qingyun Tournament,

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.370
I actually want this wedding more.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.560
Even I don't know

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.210
how important

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.450
you've become to me.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.080
You want the Diwu tree?

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:22.320
I can give it to you.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.210
I can give you anything you want,

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.080
as long as you marry me.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.280
Sure.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.610
It's just marriage. Fine by me.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.520
I see that you've formed spiritual veins.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.890
You must have

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.280
used the Diwu tree's core to make the Golden Millet Dream.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.410
Since the Diwu tree is no longer useful to you,

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:50.520
give it to me,

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.520
and I'll marry you.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.850
I'll marry you once, twice, however many times you want.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.170
How could you say that like it means nothing to you?

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.970
You were once the only reason I was alive.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.080
Why do you have to hurt me like this?

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:10.800
Once?

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:13.480
What about now?

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.170
Are you living for yourself now?

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:18.760
As long as you're by my side,

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.210
nothing else matters.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:34.080
Is that so?

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.610
Then let me be the Crown Prince of Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.040
It's true. I'm not the same as before.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.170
But from now on, as long as you're with me,

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.610
you won't need

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.560
to fight for recognition like in Jixing Abyss,

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.520
or fear being abandoned

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.080
like in Yaoguang Mountain.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.970
But that's not love.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.210
If you love someone,

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.480
you won't dig a pit for her to fall into.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.000
You won't trap her here.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.320
And you won't hurt the people she cares about.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:32.560
The people she cares about?

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:33.800
Ming Yi,

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.130
who do you care about most?

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.690
Is it Ji Bozai?

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.480
Why do you care about him?

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.690
Why can't you love me, even a little?

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:54.800
What does he have that I don't?

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.850
Why do you choose him and not me?

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:03.890
Ming Yi,

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.800
can't you try to love me, even just a little?

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.130
Just a little.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.690
The Diwu tree is right here.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:35.240
Shall we continue?

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:36.800
I don't mind.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:41.610
Ji Bozai?

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.720
You tricked me.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.650
But I am clearly Chao Yuan's target.

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:54.560
Even if it's a trap,

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.510
- even if it's a deadly one... - Wait.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.240
I have to go.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:58.930
Perfect timing.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:59.970
Talk some sense into her.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:01.850
You can't go alone.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.930
- Don't try to dissuade me. - I mean,

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.080
I know I can't stop you.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.000
I'll go with you.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.610
Chao Yuan wants to lure you into a meeting,

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:10.930
and it's clear

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:13.170
he intends to claim you for himself.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:14.130
So,

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.000
I'll disguise myself as you and meet him.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.210
That way, we can buy some time.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.690
Meanwhile, you and the others

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.170
can search Zhushui Palace for the Diwu tree.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.850
A trap for a trap. You're welcome.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.480
Your Heavenly Grief has flared up.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.850
You're already at your limit.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.650
Are you really going to fight me?

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:04.800
Are you all right?

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:07.480
Not dying yet.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.240
Immortal Situ,

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.890
this may be the last time I call you that.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.650
Now that I've been cured of the Heavenly Grief,

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:19.890
you're no match for me.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.130
Give up.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.370
I was wondering how

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.370
your spiritual veins recovered.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.690
Ji Bozai doesn't have the Golden Millet Dream.

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:33.970
He spread false news

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.280
to lure

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.480
those who covet it.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.370
He never had the antidote.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:44.690
You lied to me.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.930
Ji Bozai had the Golden Millet Dream all along.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.970
He gave you the antidote.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:04.280
How touching.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.890
You're both willing to risk your lives to protect each other.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.210
I suppose

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.930
you really are a perfect match.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.240
This...

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.890
hurts more than being killed.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.850
You planted the Diwu tree in your own heart?

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.450
What are you doing?

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:32.000
You...

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:33.690
You...

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.370
Isn't the Diwu tree so precious to you?

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.850
Then let me

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.890
destroy it

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.210
right before your eyes!

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.690
Chao Yuan.

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:44.560
Chao Yuan!

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:00.080
Let's go.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.080
You're not going anywhere.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.520
Ji Bozai!

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.210
Your Lordship,

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.080
we've taken down all the guards outside.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:09.320
Let's wait for her outside.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.130
Why save me?

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:35.520
Wouldn't it be better

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.850
to let me die?

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.320
Chao Yuan,

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.720
I once told you

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.970
that you might develop

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.080
spiritual veins of your own one day

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:48.210
or change the rule

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.450
that only those with spiritual veins

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:52.320
could become warriors,

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.000
and that one day, you'd become truly powerful.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.170
Now, you've done it.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.040
You've become Crown Prince of Zhushui Spiritual State

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:03.410
and developed spiritual veins.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.480
You've achieved it all.

00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:10.250
But are you still yourself?

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:16.000
Since you've chosen to be Chao Yuan,

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.730
our paths have diverged.

00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:23.410
When we meet again, don't hold back.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:31.120
♪Yet still looking back in the next life♪

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:35.280
♪I wish to borrow the moonlight's glow♪

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:39.060
♪To write a dream of fleeting life♪

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:44.890
♪Even if old dreams fade in flames, the wish remains unpaid♪

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:49.240
♪So I scattered the moonlight into dust♪

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:53.120
♪Let the memories gaze afar♪

00:34:53.260 --> 00:35:02.170
♪That is how I loved, with all my stubborn pride♪

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.160
It's done! I've made the Golden Millet Dream!

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.200
Really? Really!

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:12.600
Fairy Ming Yi,

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:13.680
please wait.

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.970
Before it's refined,

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:17.730
it can't be taken directly.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:20.450
It must be planted in the body to take effect.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.410
Let me do it.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.410
Ji Bozai...

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:06.410
Ji Bozai!

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:07.120
Your Lordship.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.120
What's happening?

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.680
His spiritual veins have recovered,

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:12.160
and the Heavenly Grief is gone.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.520
Why is this happening?

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.770
The Golden Millet Dream can purge the poison,

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.810
but it's excruciating to have it planted in the body.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.040
It feels as if one were being flayed alive.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.080
But when he put the Golden Millet Dream into a scallion pancake

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:32.120
and tricked me into eating it,

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:32.730
I didn't...

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:36.810
Because His Lordship

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.480
took all the pain for you when refining the Golden Millet Dream.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.080
Now that it has come to this,

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:43.970
there's something I must tell you on his behalf.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.290
The truth is,

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.330
he never truly wanted to leave you.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.450
He learned the secret

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:55.680
of the Sky-Swallowing Array.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:58.930
When he said those things to you,

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:00.890
he was simply using the sharpest blade

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:03.770
to sever his bond with you.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:12.410
Ming Yi...

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:25.850
Master She.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:28.770
- Let's go prepare medicine for His Lordship. - All right.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:29.890
Go ahead.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:30.970
You know

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:32.890
Buxiu isn't exactly the sharpest.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.370
- And he can never control the heat properly. - Right.

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:36.930
We can't do it without you.

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:39.370
Come on, Master She.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.600
You two

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.680
really can't do anything without me, can you?

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:44.680
Yes, you're right.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.330
I told you

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.890
to watch and learn

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.000
when I refined medicine, didn't I?

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:50.930
Yes, you did.

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:51.890
You should've paid attention.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:52.850
But did you?

♪I'll still be your light♪

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.250
Why didn't you tell me?

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:30.480
Tell you what?

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.600
You refined the Golden Millet Dream

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:35.000
in your own way, didn't you?

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.970
That's why I didn't feel any pain when I took it.

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.250
It was nothing worth mentioning.

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:42.330
Buxiu really can't keep a secret.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:43.680
Nothing worth mentioning?

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:45.560
Fine. Then here's another question.

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:47.330
Why did you decide on your own

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:48.770
to stop the Sky-Swallowing Array

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:49.850
by sacrificing yourself?

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.120
You forced open

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.120
your Spirit Well to save me,

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.810
and that caused the relapse of the Heavenly Grief.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.930
You couldn't even handle the winged leech

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:00.120
that Situ Ling gave you.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.370
If Buxiu hadn't told me all this,

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:03.560
were you planning to keep it from me

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:04.480
until the day you died?

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.330
I made that decision long ago.

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:15.080
There was no need to tell you.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:20.850
Hold it steady, cat claws.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.890
Don't spill it.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.480
It took a lot of effort to brew.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.410
Yes, Master She.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.890
And mind you, the herbs are very expensive.

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:33.370
What's going on?

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.810
Did His Lordship wake up?

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:37.000
He did,

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:38.730
but he might not be coming out anytime soon.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.200
That won't do!

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:41.900
Ming Yi!

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:43.770
- Ming Yi! - Master She, calm down.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:44.640
Master She.

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.250
Ming Yi was the one who sealed us out.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:48.410
Maybe we shouldn't interfere

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:49.640
in whatever they're doing.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:50.520
We shouldn't interfere?

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.850
That's my daughter in there!

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:53.000
She can't be taken advantage of!

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.290
- Ming Yi! - Calm down...

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:55.640
Uh, the medicine's gone cold.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.330
We should reheat it.

00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:59.040
Just warm it up with your spiritual power.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.970
No, Master She,

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.560
it'll mean more if you do it yourself.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.450
You two, let go of me!

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:04.890

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.560
I raised you for nothing!

My Heavenly Grief is gone.

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:11.970
You think you can keep me here?

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.410
Do you enjoy clinging to me like this?

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:27.680
I do.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:30.290
There's nothing I enjoy more.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:39.330
I'm not arguing with you.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.080
