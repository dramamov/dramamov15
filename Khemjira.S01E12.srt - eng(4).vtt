00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.040
Ramphueng won't hear anything

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.760
we say in this room.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.960
I'll go over the whole plan just once.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.320
I was hoping you'd have a plan.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.280
Don't fail me,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.520
or every last one of you

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.360
will be wiped out tonight.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.920
You don't need to
bear all of this alone anymore.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.280
No, Charn.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.640
Come, Ramphueng.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.880
Let's end this.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.720
Soon, you will see what I can do.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.680
And you probably didn't know

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.570
when I said

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.940
Khem must die at 21,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.080
I never said it had to be at midnight.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.800
He was born at six in the morning.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.610
Peem!

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.880
Khem, stay focused.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.120
Do not step out of the ring.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.680
Keep your faith in him.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.390
Please stop.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.960
My life is all you want, right?

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.880
I will leave this ring.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.720
Do it.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.910
Please let everyone go.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.410
Stop whining

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.940
and come out.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.960
Will you promise me

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.240
that you'll let them go?

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.279
I owe you no promises.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.540
The shaman made it clear, didn't he?

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.180
I meant to curse only you.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.480
You are the one I have issues with.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.280
They're not with you yet?

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.920
I even heard strange noises
coming from the forest.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.800
Should I go and check?

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:03.960
Hold on.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.200
It's too risky.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.520
Charn,

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.920
is Khem...

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.460
still alive?

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.480
I can sense that Khem's still alive,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.659
but that doesn't mean he's safe.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.980
We're on our way
to see Jane at Khem's dorm.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.800
Can you have someone pick us up?

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.720
It'll still be hours at best,

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.880
but I'll have a chopper sent.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.780
Send me your location.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.120
Calm down, Jet.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.360
All we can do right now is...

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.290
trust the people there.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.850
And you, Kachen,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.660
please go inside and pray for Khem, too.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.770
Sure.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.480
I'll keep you posted.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.140
Venerable,

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.500
I beg you.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.360
Do not interfere.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.700
I'm not here to stop you,

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.500
but indulge me
with one question, will you?

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.419
I have no time for your riddle.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:41.820
Answer me.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.700
I wish to know

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.590
what you

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.300
truly want?

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.780
I want only Khem's life.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.800
Are you deaf and blind, Venerable?

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.040
I'll ask again.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.680
What do you really want?

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.740
Once you take this boy's life,

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.960
what will you gain?

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.880
Is it merely to settle a grudge?

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.040
That alone

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.520
will satisfy me.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.060
Is that really all you want?

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.540
It is.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.380
Even if I must descend
into the deepest hell,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.680
I accept it.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:37.980
In that case,

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.190
I must apologize

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.720
for taking your time

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.900
because this...

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.840
isn't the end of it.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.360
What are you saying?

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.080
Peem...

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.670
Khem!

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.880
You've still got power left?

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:57.080
(Incanting)

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.620
Peem!

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.420
Why?

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.140
What happened?

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.100
That's...

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.540
not a weapon made by mortals, is it?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.360
It is not.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.160
He told me

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.820
Lord of the Mountains gave it to him.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.680
That means...

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.490
a mortal body can't endure its power.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.870
And he knows that very well.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.280
He never told me that.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.620
I must admire your last struggle.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.570
You wiped out my servants all at once.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.700
Now it's time for you
to undo your spell.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.330
Let go of me

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.840
and give me that boy.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.060
Please give her what she wants.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.980
I'm ready.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.550
Khem,

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.040
don't do this.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.970
No, Khem.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.180
Go back!

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.880
You will know the pain I've felt,

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.210
Krongkwan.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.680
Argh!

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.520
Argh...

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.670
In my past life,

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.600
I let someone die right before my eyes

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.190
and did nothing.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.640
I can't let it happen again in this one.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.080
I heard a little thump.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.790
Come out soon, little one.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.920
Ma'am!

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.250
Ma'am...

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.200
Ma'am!

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.760
I saw Auntie Ramphueng...

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.440
hurl the boy into the river.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.480
No.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.320
That's not true.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.600
No, it's not true.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.240
No...

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.880
That's not me.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.360
Not at all.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.840
It has nothing to do with me.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.210
Goodbye...

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.720
Peem.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.200
How does it feel...

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.440
to watch someone you love die
before your eyes

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.910
while you can do nothing?

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:24.830
Focus your mind.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.930
Don't let anger and grief take over you.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.860
Your power
is so much stronger than hers.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.320
Focus, okay?

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.560
- You've got this, Master.
- You've got this, Master.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.540
Stay calm, Wat.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.000
Why are you here?

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.080
Mom?

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:43.910
(Incanting)

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.120
Let go of me.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.230
Ramphueng,

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.360
you're also a mother.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.760
I'm sure you understand
why I can't let you do that.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.930
Ramphueng!

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:21.120
(Incanting)

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.580
I will imprison your soul,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.320
so you can never hurt anyone again.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.400
Would you be so kind as to spare her?

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.760
Monk Kasem...

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.840
Monk Kasem!

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.350
Stop, Ramphueng.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.360
He has nothing to do with this.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.280
Then why did he meddle?

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.160
I'll take this old man with me.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.200
What, Mom?

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.730
Let her, Master.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.360
Why aren't we helping him?

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.680
He asked us not to.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.630
No wonder you're a monk.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.920
Not even a bit shaken, huh?

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.110
When it comes to karma,

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.480
sometimes you just have to let it happen.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.180
But Ramphueng,

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.560
if you use too much of your power,

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.140
your soul will shatter.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.970
Don't act like you know everything.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.550
Before you take me,

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.100
may I show something...

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.130
to you?

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.490
After all,

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.330
our fates are finally...

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.360
intertwined...

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.300
once more.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.970
Once more?

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.640
What are you talking about?

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.510
Quit riddling.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.600
Om...

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.600
You old monk,

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.270
what did you do to me?

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.160
I wish to know

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.240
what you

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.940
truly want?

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.420
I want only Khem's life.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.920
Is that really all you want?

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:00.740
You must suffer like I did...

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.980
as I was parted from my son.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.730
My son,

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.940
go live your life,

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.010
grow strong,

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.850
and be free.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.200
I'm sorry

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.240
that my fate

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.800
has granted you so little.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.980
There, there.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:31.350
There, there.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.270
Don't cry, sweetie.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.400
Aw, honey.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.080
There, there.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.840
There, there.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.400
I'm right here, honey.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.810
Whatever you're holding on to,

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:07.780
let it go...

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:11.520
Mother.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:19.870
There, there.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.440
Sweetie,

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:22.920
I'm right here.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.330
Don't cry, okay?

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.280
There, there.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.400
Sweetie...

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.760
My son...

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.520
I'm sorry, Khem.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.970
I'm sorry for everything.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.010
I'll pay for my karma...

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.450
and meet him again.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.530
Please forgive me.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.280
I understand that...

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.010
you've endured so much pain and loss,

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.970
but you also made those around me suffer,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.280
those who had nothing to do
with any of this.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.720
If there is anything you want me to do,

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.560
I will do it.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.330
Please don't do this.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.360
The choice is yours, Khem.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.280
If it's your decision,

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.800
I'll accept whatever comes.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.720
- We, too, think
- We, too, think

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.080
- you should be the one to decide.
- you should be the one to decide.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.360
Whatever you choose,

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.210
we'll respect it, Khem.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.460
I can't forgive you that easily,

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.070
but if I were to take revenge,

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.600
the karma between us
would bind us forever.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.260
Just accept the punishment you deserve.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.380
I hope that in your next life,

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.440
you'll be reunited with your son.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.100
Thank you.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.010
Thank you very much.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.100
The atonement

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.280
must be grievous indeed,

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.380
but our paths will cross again.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:30.930
When that day comes,

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.140
please...

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.800
let me take care of you,

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.080
at least once, Mother.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.130
She even made you leave so soon,

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.930
but I couldn't just take revenge.

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.590
You made the right choice, sweetie.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.610
Revenge...

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.560
only breeds more revenge.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.480
You've grown into a great person, Khem.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.040
I'm very proud of you.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:42.450
It seems you're fine without me.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.770
I nearly couldn't make it, Grandma.

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:46.460
Come on,

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.160
don't be so dramatic with me.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.970
If you can't live alone,
go live with Khem.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.210
And if you ever mistreat him,

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.920
I'll haunt your dreams.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.170
I'm sorry, Grandma Si.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.330
I should be sorry.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.680
My good deeds were brief.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.320
You must've been very shocked.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:04.600
I'm sorry, Kasem,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.080
I couldn't wait until you came.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:09.280
Don't join me so soon, okay?

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.900
It puts me at ease

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.469
to see that death

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.699
can't change your sharp tongue.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.080
- Khem...
- Khem...

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.120
I didn't expect you'd come.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.360
Wow...

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.280
Is that really how someone says

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:47.040
to greet his brother after so long?

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.449
Thanks.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.020
And I'm sorry.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.620
I'm sorry that in our past life,
I failed as your brother.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.640
I neglected you,

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.010
and it led to this ending.

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.690
After paying for your karma,

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.430
I hope life treats you well.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.230
Thanks, Wat.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.090
Khem,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.720
please take care of my brother.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:26.910
So,

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.800
how has it been up there?

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.390
Just okay.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:32.730
There aren't many toys.

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:34.850
I'd rather be born again.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.480
Please take care of Khem, will you?

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.110
He's a good person.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.160
You don't have to act so cold.

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:51.090
Okay, Auntie.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.280
I'm ready, Monk Kasem.

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.890
It's finally over.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.740
Happy birthday, Khem.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:04.000
I told you

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:08.800
we'll be together

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.410
this year

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.730
and for all the years to come.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.450
Mm.

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.330
Thank you.

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:29.470
Remember, Khem...

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:33.970
I choose you.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.730
Okay.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.230
Peem!

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.170
Peem...

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:52.530
Are you okay?

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:53.920
Peem!

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:31.570
Khem!

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:32.840
- Khem!
- Khem...

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.680
- Khem...
- Khem!

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.880
Jet, Charn!

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.670
Khem!

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:47.890
- We made it!
- We made it!

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:50.510
We did it, Khem.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:51.480
From now on,

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.240
we'll stay friends
for the rest of our lives.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.040
Khem...

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:58.860
Miss you!

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:02.120
Pay your respects to Monk Kasem
before he leaves.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.080
I'm about to take him to the station.

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:14.510
I'm truly grateful, Monk Kasem,

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:16.210
that you saved my friend.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:17.960
It's nothing.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.570
I'm glad I could help,

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.480
and we could settle
the matters left unresolved.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.290
I've heard about...

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:27.070
your past life.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.600
I have one question, though.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.720
Ask me.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:34.450
So,

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.120
when did you realize

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.120
that Ramphueng was your mother?

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.560
And when you did,

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.960
did you try to find her?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.440
When you met us,

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.200
why didn't you tell us right away?

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.680
And in the forest,

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.520
why didn't you just tell her the truth?

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.870
Why couldn't Khem
keep the yantra wrapped all the time?

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.480
And why wouldn't you let Master stay
in the sacred ring, too?

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:56.960
Why did you wait until Master got hurt

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.240
and even put yourself in danger?

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.750
You said you had one question.

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:04.350
Well, yeah...

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.910
It's okay.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.810
Some things...

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.210
had to be allowed to happen,

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.880
so the karma we were bound by

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:14.820
could be settled easily.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.160
Had to be allowed to happen?

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:20.520
Do you mean...

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.440
Paran...

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.120
had to lose his power.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:30.070
Only then would you sacrifice yourself

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.540
as you couldn't lose the one you love.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.480
At that moment, those you loved

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.560
would come to help.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.060
And only then...

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.160
Ramphueng

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.100
would target me.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.320
So she'd been haunting me

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.060
not only to avenge herself

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.520
but also her son.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:58.950
What she truly wanted

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:02.270
was to see her son once again.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.520
So,

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.280
she had to almost kill me

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.540
to find out the truth.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.280
She had to realize

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:17.960
she almost lost her own son again
by her own hands

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.780
before she could let everything go.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.550
I get it now.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:29.180
If she had known earlier,

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.580
she'd think we were tricking her.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.880
And it might've caused more losses.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.680
But...

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.200
you mentioned
Master had to lose his power...

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:44.160
Just temporary.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.800
He'll regain it soon enough.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.320
Khem,

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.280
don't worry.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.610
I'm sure that...

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.990
he meant to do this from the start.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.080
Remember, Khem...

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.640
I choose you.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.200
Peem...

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.080
I choose you, too.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.260
Now,

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.620
wake up soon, okay?

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:53.630
Mm.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.190
Peem?

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.280
Peem...

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.750
He told you everything, didn't he?

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.320
Peem,

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:27.710
from now on,

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:32.990
I'll take care of you.

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:37.100
I'll bring you food

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.230
and water,

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.100
get a job,

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.560
earn money,

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.920
and support you, Peem.

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.840
I just lost my power,

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.320
not my ability to move.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.070
I just want to repay you.

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:16.150
You've done so much for me.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.960
Just having you here, Khem,

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.520
is the greatest thing
I could ever ask for.

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.880
For the rest of this new life of yours,

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:40.650
I want to always be part of it.

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.830
I thought he said he was rich.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.640
Why isn't he staying at a nice hotel?

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.870
He could get a ride anytime.

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:33.270
That's just how he is.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.520
He always does whatever he wants.

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:41.670
Hey,

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.070
I've already...

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:46.260
ignored it several times.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.180
So, what's going on

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.320
between you and Kachen?

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:54.530
Well,

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.180
nothing's going on.

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:01.390
Come on, tell me.

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:03.190
What's wrong?

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:12.420
So,

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:14.620
don't get mad at me,

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.860
but he said something like...

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.000
he was your first.

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.370
What's so funny about that?

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.030
You literally said I was your first.

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:32.880
And now...

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:34.950
you expect me to not be offended?

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.120
He was the first
to let me ride in a sports car,

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.500
take me out,

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:43.590
take me drinking,
and act wild with me at concerts.

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.760
That's why Jane doesn't like him.

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.040
What's this?

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.280
"CLUB NEPTUNE..."

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.800
It's the massage parlor

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:22.640
he signed me up for as a member.

00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:23.490
Huh?

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:26.310
He gave it to me on my 18th birthday.

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:28.050
He wanted me to go so badly,

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:29.460
but I've never been there.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.040
I told him I had, though.

00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:33.530
That's why he's so proud

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.200
and claimed
he made me lose my virginity.

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:41.670
I see.

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:46.270
Actually, I wasn't thinking much
about it.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.320
You're the one...

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:54.670
who took my first time.

00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:58.950
You took my first time

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.440
and my heart.

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:09.280
Night-night, my first one.

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:10.240
Wait...

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.730
How am I supposed to sleep now?
Don't sleep yet.

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.120
Wake up.

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.120
How can I sleep now?

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:25.230
Jet, wake up!

00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:47.810
Oh,

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:49.390
you're up so early.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:51.630
Should I serve you breakfast?

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:52.640
Where's everyone?

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.480
Oh,

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:56.070
Jet and Charn had their breakfast

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.760
and already rode off on the bike.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.200
Master hasn't come downstairs yet.

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.850
Did you know...

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:05.190
before you came back last night,

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:08.470
Jet and Charn...

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.000
Wait,

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:12.720
did Monk Kasem forget something?

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:24.250
Oh...

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.000
Why didn't you wake me up, too?

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.290
Master...

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.920
What did I tell you?

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:39.100
Call me Peem when we're by ourselves.

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:40.870
Well,

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.070
we're not by ourselves right now.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.110
This is...

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:57.030
Monk Pinyo,

00:52:57.730 --> 00:52:58.950
my father.

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:09.280
Good morning,

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:10.510
Monk Pinyo.

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:23.430
Your suffering has come to an end.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.240
May your life
finally be filled with joy.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:28.900
Thank you, Father.

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:31.160
Father,

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:34.350
now that everything's over,

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.680
will you leave the monkhood?

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:41.970
I mean...

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:45.810
I just want you to live...

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.320
your own life.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.730
I am content with my life.

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.120
Master,

00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:59.680
I sincerely thank you

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.420
for going through all the trouble
to help my son.

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.270
Please don't mention it.

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:05.230
It's no trouble.

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:06.880
I'm more than willing.

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.450
Anyway, don't rush things.

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.640
Khem still hasn't completed his studies.

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:17.190
Father!

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:19.970
I'm not against it.

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.150
I just feel that now that Khem...

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.720
has his freedom,

00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:27.280
I want him to enjoy life fully for now.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.670
There's no need
to rush into settling down.

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:34.510
Settling down?

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:36.180
Come on, Father.

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.320
I...

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:39.750
I haven't really thought that far ahead.

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.400
I'm just saying what a father would.

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.160
After all, it's your choice.

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.350
If you stay strong, Khem,

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.920
I entrust you, Master,
to take care of my son.

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:56.790
I promise

00:54:57.890 --> 00:55:00.680
to take the very best care of your son.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.000
Come on,

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.880
what are you talking about?

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.450
Khem!

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.010
Oh,

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.540
Uncle Chai?

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:18.990
Is everything okay?

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.520
Uncle Chai?

00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:23.890
Oh,

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:25.830
you don't see him?

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:27.580
Khem,

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:30.410
let Master know

00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:32.290
I'm waiting downstairs.

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:33.790
Okay.

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:40.180
He can leave his body now, can't he?

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:46.270
Since when could you do it?

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.830
Not so long ago.

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:51.470
Master,

00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:53.940
we all know...

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.070
what happened to you.

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:00.640
Oh,

00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:02.320
Charn said all your disciples

00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:04.060
have the right to know.

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:04.710
Hey,

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.590
you agreed with me, didn't you?

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:07.590
Don't just blame me.

00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.000
I'm not blaming you.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.830
They'll all find out sooner or later.

00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:14.110
So, Master,

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:15.750
you saw it just now

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:17.940
that I can leave my body.

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:20.120
So from now on,

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:22.750
please let me handle...

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.330
the villagers' troubles.

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:28.010
Okay.

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.280
Master...

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:38.640
Right,

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:40.680
Mek and Lah

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.000
often go into the forest,

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.640
so the nymphs favor them

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:45.670
and have granted them sacred wood.

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:47.980
If anything bad happens
in the forest again,

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.830
we'll take care of it.

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:51.230
Right.

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:52.710
You don't need to worry, Master.

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:54.770
Master,

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.950
I'll take a part-time job

00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:59.910
as an invocation performer.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.440
Don't worry.

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.000
Mother Si left me this.

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:06.640
Master,

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.280
from now on,

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.470
just...

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:11.960
keep training.

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:13.830
If you can't master it in five years,

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:15.570
take ten, twenty,
or as long as it takes.

00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:18.150
Just don't worry about us anymore.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.480
So there'll be nothing left
for me to do, will there?

00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:22.670
Come on!

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:24.640
That's not it, Master.

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.640
You're still our master

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.940
who will be here to guide us,

00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:30.950
right?

00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:32.150
- Yeah.
- Right.

00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:32.990
Yes.

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.990
No matter what,

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:37.600
we still love and respect you,

00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:38.660
right?

00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:39.230
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:40.050
Right.

00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:41.850
Come on now.

00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:43.110
- Come.
- Let's give our blessings to him.

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:45.580
Alright,

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:47.220
may you stay healthy

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:48.870
and take good care of yourself.

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.560
- Sadhu.
- Sadhu.

00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:55.690
He's such a kind person,
loved by so many.

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.160
- Knowing that he loves and protects you
- Now give him what you brought.

00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:00.830
- eases my heart.
- Come on.

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:02.020
Some fruits...

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:03.750
Brought so many, huh?

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.460
Come on,

00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:09.990
do you even know what you said?

00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:12.530
It's making me blush.

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:15.530
I'm truly happy

00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:19.380
that you've finally
found the silver lining.

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:22.650
Alright, let's join hands
and cheer Master up.

00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:24.930
Gosh,

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.480
now that we're actually leaving,

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.570
I can't help but feel a little sad.

00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:32.270
Anyway,

00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:33.550
does Master happen to have

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:35.580
any charms
that could help me catch up in class?

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:53.150
Kachen told me

00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.070
Thong and Ake
even came to save Khem.

00:58:58.610 --> 00:58:59.720
So that means...

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:03.280
they're in a better place now, right?

00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.990
Yeah.

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:06.960
That's such a relief.

00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:15.490
Jet,

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.780
for the rest of my life,

00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:23.120
I'll always be right beside you.

00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.350
What's with you?

00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:27.050
Getting cheesy all of a sudden?

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:29.190
Well,

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.960
I just wanted you to know that

00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:34.190
no matter what happens,

00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:36.390
you'll always have me.

00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.190
The moment you let yourself
go down that bridge with me,

00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:55.110
I already knew

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:56.550
you weren't going anywhere.

00:59:59.150 --> 01:00:01.150
If you tell me to go down,

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.280
I'll make sure I go down a storm.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.880
If you tell me to dive,

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:11.170
I promise I won't go off the deep end.

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:12.390
What's this, huh?

01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:14.280
You're cracking jokes now?

01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:16.230
Well, it was getting too cheesy,

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:19.300
so I had to balance it out,

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.760
right, babe?

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:22.470
Hm?

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:23.960
Babe?

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:27.920
Well,

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:30.150
you said when things are settled,

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.880
we can continue where we left off,
didn't you?

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.200
But you've never made it clear

01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:40.870
if we're officially dating or not.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.180
Babe!

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.000
Clear enough?

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:54.530
Nope.

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:57.330
That wasn't clear.

01:00:58.110 --> 01:00:59.910
Can you say it...

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.370
♫The one who makes my dreams come true,♫

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:09.080
♫The one in my heart, baby, it's you♫

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:13.930
♫It's you I've been longing for,♫

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:18.200

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.440
♫Right by my side, it's truly you♫

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.240
♫Clearly, my heart beats just for you♫

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:31.070
♫It's you I want, nothing more♫

01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:36.430
♫From now on, you'll be my all♫

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.200
How is your father?

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.960
He's staying
at the temple in the village.

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.800
He should be heading back soon.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:34.560
Is something the matter?

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:41.640
So...

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:47.320
I haven't started my training yet.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.960
Whatever I couldn't do
back when I was a shaman,

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.440
I can do it now.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.960
Wanna stay in my room tonight?

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.160
Why do you keep looking into my eyes?

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.320
You have beautiful eyes.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.200
Oh...

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.120
Sorry.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.440
It's okay.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.720
Wanna look into them closer?

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.360
Open your eyes.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.600
You wanted to take a closer look,
didn't you?

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.400
Do you really want to do this,

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.440
or are you just trying to please me?

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.680
I really want it.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.080
Then we'll go all the way
this time, okay?

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.470
We're taking our leave, Master.

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:40.380
Anytime,

01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:44.700
you're always welcome here, Khem.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.280
Okay, Peem.

01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:48.720
Not just that.

01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:53.820
Call me...

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.330
the way you did last night.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.680
This name...

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.880
was the one my mom wanted to give me,

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.700
but it got turned down.

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.320
Only she ever called me that.

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.200
After she passed,

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.640
no one's called me by it again.

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.520
From now on,

01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:32.340
I'll be your...

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.120
Alright, my Peem.

will you?

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.920
Does it poke your eye?

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.730
Do I need to get closer?

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:34.000
Looking good.

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.900
Here I am.

01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:37.670
Did you get started already?

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.040
Not yet.

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.150
We were waiting for everyone.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:42.560
Anyway,

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:44.800
why did you finish
your grooming so fast?

01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:46.480
No, no.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:49.050
We're not grooms. We're just boyfriends.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.800
He's talking about your makeup!

01:18:53.770 --> 01:18:54.870
Come here, Khem.

01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.560
I'll put some sunscreen on your face.

01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:01.360
Alright.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.310
Not too much, okay?

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.720
I know you didn't get to tell Khemmika

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:16.200
in your past life,

01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:18.510
but in this one,

01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:20.560
you don't have to tell me
every chance you get, you know.

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.060
That should be enough.

01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:36.720
It's perfect.

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:37.840
- Let me see.
- Okay.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.320
Wow,

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.950
my face is literally glowing.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.280
That's how
tone-up sunscreens work, right?

01:20:45.370 --> 01:20:46.630
Alright, let's get some photos

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.840

I meant Master.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.480
You won't get to go soon.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.520
Whoa,

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.400
looks like he was in such a hurry.

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.280

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.030
Wow, that's so beautiful.

You're right.

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:46.680
I'm back.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.200
Was it a long wait?

01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:51.730
I have waited longer than this before.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.120
Welcome back to Ubon Ratchathani, Khem.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.240
Yeah.

01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:13.470
Let me take that.

01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:30.940
Alright, let's do it.

01:22:31.450 --> 01:22:32.010
Come on.

01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.750
Let's go

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.090
Okay.

Let's go.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.210
Okay.

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:12.180
Let's go!

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:13.800
- The Bun Bang Fai Festival!
- Come on.

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:17.940
Hurry.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.680
Don't forget the tripod.

01:24:04.810 --> 01:24:05.640
Dad...

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:10.480
What?

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:12.840
This is my darling.

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:19.910
Hello, Dad.

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.400
I'm Charnvit Charoenkiatpreecha.

01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:25.320
So,

01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:27.240
I'm gay.

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.160
Jet's also gay.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.480
We're crazy in love.

01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:35.400
I promise

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.320
I'll take the best care

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:39.120
of your son.

01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:53.980
Bear with him, okay?

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:55.120
He's a handful.

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.920
Come on, Dad!

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.400
Enjoy yourselves.

01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.840
Go ahead. Enjoy.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.520
Why did you need to say your full name,

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:11.300
huh?

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:13.130
Trying to flaunt your last name?

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.240
Well, I just changed it.

01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:16.680
How about...

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.240
changing yours to mine, too?

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.170
Let's get some ice cream.

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:43.560
Having fun, huh?

01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:48.610
Seems like
we can't get away from each other.

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:49.590
Obviously.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Thanks for saving my brother, though.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.600
Consider helping me
next time, too, alright?

01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:03.960
That ghost smacked me into a closet,

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.160
and I woke up all alone

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.390
with no lover around.

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.040
Sorry.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.400
I did call the ambulance, though.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:12.840
Thanks.

01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:17.220
Anyway, it's better

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.360
that he got away from you
and met a good guy like Charn.

01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:23.880
Are you Jane,

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.240
Jet's sister?

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:27.050
Yes.

01:26:28.090 --> 01:26:28.930
Here.

01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:31.300
You're invited to Prim's wedding.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:32.520
Oh...

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:35.770
She's sent her apologies
for not inviting you herself.

01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:37.410
She has some matters to attend to.

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:41.160
Thank you. I'll make sure to come.

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.600
- See you.
- See you.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:44.280
Prim's getting married?

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:50.680
Yeah.

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:53.160
Here's yours.

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:54.120
Sorry?

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.040
You're invited to her wedding.

01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.650
You can either come as a guest

01:26:59.970 --> 01:27:01.320
or help out with the preparations.

01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:05.490
You're trying to use me, huh?

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.330
Sure,

01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:09.000
I'll definitely come.

01:27:11.530 --> 01:27:12.840
Right, so...

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.530
Prim mentioned...

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.520
you're joining her faculty
as a professor?

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.260
Are you serious?

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:22.920
Someone like you...

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.080
can easily be one in Bangkok.

01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:26.630
I'm serious.

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:29.840
I don't plan on leaving here.

01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.950
Was my accent alright?

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.240
It was close.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.820
You sounded almost like a native.

01:27:35.170 --> 01:27:35.750
So...

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.040
how are things with Master?

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.240
Are you still together?

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.320
Are we, Khem?

01:27:53.070 --> 01:27:55.710
Prim said you've been making a move
on a physical therapist.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.250
Pong!

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:01.080
So you're both taken, huh?

01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:03.780
So,

01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:06.590
allow me
to show my boyfriend the rocket.

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:08.320
Sure.

01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:09.830
Take good care of yourselves.

01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:12.780
Okay.

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:09.850
We're about to fire the rocket!

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.840
Alright, that's enough. Listen up.

01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:20.330
First of all,

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:21.650
let's make a prayer.

01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:25.420
Dear Phaya Thaen and the deities,

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:28.180
may this year bring abundant rain,

01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:30.260
- and may everything be prosperous
- It's so nice

01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:32.500
- so we can finally live in happiness.
- that we're all here.

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:36.240
- Please! Sadhu.
- Sadhu!

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:37.300
Isn't it wonderful?

01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:40.450
We've grown up,

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:42.640
but our love remains the same.

01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:45.700
So...

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.540
how's everything?

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.240
Have you been training a lot?

01:29:52.290 --> 01:29:54.120
Is your power back to how it used to be?

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:55.120
Hey,

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:56.960
fire the rocket now!

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.590
Do it.

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:17.360
Off it goes! Wow, that's so high.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.160
It's really high!

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.630
Wow, that's high!

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:31.530
Wow, that's incredible.

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.730
May this year bring rain everywhere!

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:18.760
(Casting a spell)

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:44.640
My Peem,

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:47.480
what are you doing?

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.080
Nothing.

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:53.120
Wait...

01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.400
Are you wearing perfume today?

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:03.880
Trying something new, you know.

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.720
Come on, let's go.

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:07.860
Alright.

01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:13.310
Charn, Jet!

01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.180
- Let's go.
- Alright.

01:33:17.630 --> 01:33:19.010
Took so many pics, didn't you?

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.200

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:15.440

What is it?

01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.810
Our wedding date.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.980
Your father suggested
we hold the wedding

01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:17.200
and register a marriage on the same day.

01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:41.280
I once told you

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:45.160
I'd do everything to keep you safe.

01:35:53.530 --> 01:35:55.940
For the rest of your life,

01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:58.120
I want you to spend it with me.

01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:11.490
Will you marry me, Khem?

01:36:23.650 --> 01:36:24.380
I do.

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:31.240
You've always protected
and taken care of me.

01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:01.920
This is amazing, honey.

01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:05.440
Whoa,

01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:06.760
Singha,

01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:10.140
did you put in
half of this ThyChef sachet?

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:14.760
'Cause you said
it'd make the food super tasty!

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:20.000
It's gonna be spicy.

01:42:21.850 --> 01:42:23.200
"Ten times spicy."

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.960
Is "ten times" a lot?

01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:27.960
Is it too spicy, Dad?

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:28.960
Not at all.

01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:30.220
It's incredible

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:31.680
and perfectly spicy.

01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:33.960
I'll make sure to eat all of this.

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:38.520
Next time, I'll cook for you, too.

01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.480
And I'll add all of this sachet!

01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:42.260
Whoa,

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:44.640
that really makes me happy.

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.060
Finish your meal

01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:48.100
and come play with us, okay?

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:50.700
I'll be there first!

01:42:51.150 --> 01:42:52.960
- Hey, don't run.
- I'll be there first!

01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:01.360
You don't need to force yourself.

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:04.710
I'm not.

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:07.080
Our son made this for me.

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:10.200
Can I get some water, though?

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:12.450
Oh...

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.180
It's kinda funny, actually.

01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.340
I guess I'm facing my karma.

01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:47.680
I used to spank Thong and Ake a lot,

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.770
and now I'm paying for it.

01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:56.320
But it's a happy life, isn't it?

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:01.560
Very happy.

01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:26.040
By the way,

01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:30.400
have I thanked you today?

01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:33.660
Come on,

01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:36.400
you don't have to say it every day.

01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:39.520
I just love my hubby.

01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:47.200
Want a spicy kiss?

01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:13.390
Suea, Singha!

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:26.290
Going too far again, huh?

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Come here.

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:29.760
