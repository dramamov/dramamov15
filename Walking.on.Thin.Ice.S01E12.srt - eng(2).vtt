WALKING ON THIN ICE

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:44.105
DRUG USE ISN’T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

00:00:44.147 --> 00:00:45.453
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:47.104
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

00:01:16.313 --> 00:01:17.172
Honey.

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:26.535
Dad?

00:01:50.397 --> 00:01:52.105
Honey! Honey!

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.522
Honey!

00:01:56.147 --> 00:01:57.272
Dad...

00:01:59.772 --> 00:02:00.814
Honey...

00:02:03.272 --> 00:02:04.856
Look at me, Honey.

00:02:23.605 --> 00:02:25.138
Now it finally feels fair.

00:02:30.104 --> 00:02:34.023
From now on,
life will feel like hell.

00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:36.329
Just as I feel.

00:02:56.772 --> 00:02:58.586
Call 911. Hurry!

00:03:00.023 --> 00:03:01.981
Honey, honey!

00:03:03.314 --> 00:03:05.397
Honey, no!

00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:07.230
It's okay.

00:03:07.272 --> 00:03:10.104
Honey, wake up.
Look at me.

00:03:10.105 --> 00:03:12.856
My dad is...

00:03:12.897 --> 00:03:19.104
Haengbok-ro 32-gil...
Please come quickly!

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.023
- No, no!
- Dad!

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:27.104
Look at me.
Open your eyes, please...

00:03:27.104 --> 00:03:28.647
Dad...

00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:30.397
Honey...

00:03:31.104 --> 00:03:33.091
Dad!

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.385
Don't die, please...

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:46.897
Dad!

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.939
EPISODE 12

00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:00.856
PARK DOJIN
1979 – 2021

00:04:26.443 --> 00:04:27.543
Honey...

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:36.897
PARK DOJIN
1979 – 2021

00:05:04.772 --> 00:05:09.777
Lieutenant Park Bohee and
Mr. Park Dojin were killed.

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.970
- Park Dojin?
- Yes, Kang Eunsoo's husband.

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.205
Jang Taegu killed them,
and he's still on the run.

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:22.106
What are you saying?

00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:27.013
So from now on,
tell me everything straight.

00:05:27.397 --> 00:05:31.013
If you don't, I'll make sure
you never leave prison.

00:05:42.888 --> 00:05:44.055
Thank you.

00:05:46.104 --> 00:05:47.230
Be careful.

00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:54.104
Mrs. Kang Eunsoo.

00:05:56.538 --> 00:05:59.104
You're under arrest for drug trafficking.

00:05:59.147 --> 00:06:01.147
You have the right to remain silent,

00:06:01.188 --> 00:06:02.605
and the right to an attorney.

00:06:02.647 --> 00:06:06.772
Anything you say can be used
against you in court.

00:06:06.814 --> 00:06:07.885
Do you understand?

00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:12.355
Mom...

00:06:12.397 --> 00:06:14.104
It's okay, Sua.

00:06:35.302 --> 00:06:39.731
Jang Taegu had an accident
in a mountain area outside Seoul.

00:06:40.104 --> 00:06:42.104
There were traces of gunfire at the scene.

00:06:44.647 --> 00:06:50.104
He claimed he'd been attacked
while meeting an informant,

00:06:50.104 --> 00:06:53.439
but you drove down the same highway
leading to the crime scene.

00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:56.023
The next day,
you replaced your bumper.

00:06:56.104 --> 00:06:59.152
You two were with
Jang Taegu that night, weren't you?

00:06:59.355 --> 00:07:02.314
Because all of you sold Vaka together.

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.147
EVIDENCE NO.1

00:07:21.564 --> 00:07:23.772
Who filmed it?

00:07:35.064 --> 00:07:36.397
Sua.

00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:40.397
You should eat, okay?

00:07:42.856 --> 00:07:47.430
Auntie, how could Mom
do such a thing?

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:54.939
Don't cry, don't cry.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.480
That's enough.

00:07:59.324 --> 00:08:02.230
You really look a lot
like your dad.

00:08:04.433 --> 00:08:05.564
Don't cry.

00:08:10.104 --> 00:08:11.358
That's not important.

00:08:11.564 --> 00:08:14.773
What's important is that
this proves both of you sold drugs.

00:08:15.304 --> 00:08:17.104
You'll be facing a long sentence.

00:08:19.806 --> 00:08:21.890
Jang Taegu tried to kill us.

00:08:22.115 --> 00:08:24.198
He started shooting like crazy,

00:08:24.272 --> 00:08:26.522
and she ran him over
trying to survive.

00:08:37.856 --> 00:08:44.105
SOMEONE GOT HIT BY A CAR HERE.
PLEASE HURRY!

00:08:44.147 --> 00:08:46.856
But we did call 911, didn't we?

00:08:46.897 --> 00:08:48.739
How did the three of you start off?

00:08:48.944 --> 00:08:50.568
I suggested it.

00:08:52.104 --> 00:08:53.104
Wait...

00:08:53.104 --> 00:08:56.770
I told her the police would never believe
she found the drug bag at home,

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.188
and convinced her to sell it to make
money for her husband's treatment.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.439
But she tried to quit halfway,
so I scared her into selling more.

00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:06.992
What are you saying...

00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:08.334
Just admit it.

00:09:08.689 --> 00:09:11.500
No, I can't do this anymore.

00:09:11.647 --> 00:09:15.397
I don't care what you feel inside.

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:20.689
Just don't get in my way
and do as you're told!

00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:24.233
Maybe you started this,
but I'll be the one to end it.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:28.023
You know Jang Taegu took money
from Phantom for intel, right?

00:09:28.064 --> 00:09:29.105
The money-grubber.

00:09:29.147 --> 00:09:33.017
When things got tight,
he screwed Phantom and threatened us.

00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:36.439
He killed Hwang Donghyun too.

00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:41.480
HE RAISED IT TO 200 MILLION.
HANDLE THIS ONE LAST TIME

00:09:42.104 --> 00:09:46.104
I tricked her into
covering my bribes.

00:09:46.104 --> 00:09:48.574
But you explained yourself later.

00:09:48.597 --> 00:09:52.480
Do you still trust me?
You think I'd give that money back?

00:09:52.522 --> 00:09:56.397
She begged me to
turn ourselves in, like an idiot.

00:09:57.678 --> 00:09:59.741
She was a complete fool.

00:10:00.452 --> 00:10:01.856
No wonder your husband is dead.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.003
Stop it!

00:10:06.174 --> 00:10:11.464
Keep this up, and you'll never
see your daughter again.

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:18.468
How could you?
How dare you?

00:10:20.148 --> 00:10:22.101
Mrs. Kang, sit down.

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:24.397
Yes, take a seat.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.147
Calm down and sit.

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:34.230
This is why I never
worked with civilians.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.268
I told you everything.
Go easy on me, alright?

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.104
DECEMBER 8TH
TWON HOLDINGS IR D-DAY

00:11:19.397 --> 00:11:22.397
DECEMBER 8TH

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:31.188
We've already put
a travel ban on him.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.761
All exits are under surveillance,
but he's vanished.

00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:37.605
Where the hell did Jang Taegu go?

00:11:38.033 --> 00:11:41.150
If we lose him now,
he'll smuggle himself overseas.

00:11:42.104 --> 00:11:44.731
Then we'll never be
able to catch him!

00:11:44.994 --> 00:11:47.134
I'll find a way, no matter what.

00:11:56.088 --> 00:11:57.756
How's your finger?

00:11:57.864 --> 00:12:01.272
What did the hospital say?
No aftereffects, right?

00:12:02.024 --> 00:12:03.064
Does that matter?

00:12:03.282 --> 00:12:06.258
Of course it does.
You're an artist.

00:12:06.282 --> 00:12:10.305
I delivered Mom's drugs,
didn't I?

00:12:11.274 --> 00:12:14.358
And Dad died because of it.

00:12:16.423 --> 00:12:17.996
I can't forgive either of us.

00:12:19.104 --> 00:12:20.535
Not me or you.

00:12:22.522 --> 00:12:23.856
No, Sua.

00:12:24.307 --> 00:12:28.016
It's not your fault.
Not one bit.

00:12:28.897 --> 00:12:31.104
It's all my fault.

00:12:31.104 --> 00:12:33.104
I lost everyone I loved.

00:12:35.166 --> 00:12:36.409
I never...

00:12:39.428 --> 00:12:40.845
...want to see you again.

00:12:42.104 --> 00:12:44.105
I came today to tell you this.

00:12:46.314 --> 00:12:49.314
Sua... Sua... Sua!

00:12:50.104 --> 00:12:51.647
Sua.

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:55.147
Sua, Sua.

00:13:00.272 --> 00:13:01.689
Mrs. Kang.

00:13:01.731 --> 00:13:03.647
Focus.
Stay with me now.

00:13:03.689 --> 00:13:07.104
Mrs. Kang! Don't lose it!

00:13:51.072 --> 00:13:54.072
It was about a week after
I joined the Drug Crimes Unit.

00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:56.814
Parents who sold their children
for drugs were arrested.

00:13:57.104 --> 00:13:59.023
It was really shocking.

00:13:59.064 --> 00:14:02.104
But after a few months,
I found out it was pretty common.

00:14:03.104 --> 00:14:05.064
What are you trying to say now?

00:14:05.104 --> 00:14:07.731
I almost believed that you
blackmailed Kang Eunsoo

00:14:07.772 --> 00:14:09.397
to sell the drugs.

00:14:09.439 --> 00:14:13.064
In reality,
you want to take the fall

00:14:13.104 --> 00:14:15.104
to save Kang Eunsoo.

00:14:15.907 --> 00:14:17.766
And what if I won't let you?

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.048
You owe me one, Detective.

00:14:20.071 --> 00:14:21.548
So I'm giving you a chance.

00:14:22.772 --> 00:14:24.397
Lure out Jang Taegu.

00:14:28.104 --> 00:14:29.605
By any means necessary.

00:14:31.057 --> 00:14:33.558
Kang Eunsoo is being offered
the same thing right now.

00:14:33.647 --> 00:14:36.731
Depending on your cooperation,
the charges may change.

00:14:37.695 --> 00:14:40.105
The police have placed Inspector
Jang Taegu on the wanted list

00:14:40.147 --> 00:14:44.104
on charges of corruption, false accusation
of a fellow officer, and murder.

00:14:44.672 --> 00:14:48.355
Police confirmed that
Inspector Jang escaped after killing

00:14:48.397 --> 00:14:50.146
his fellow officers
while being transported

00:14:50.162 --> 00:14:52.104
to the Seoul Metropolitan
Police Agency.

00:14:52.105 --> 00:14:53.128
his fellow officers
while being transported

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.105
to the Seoul Metropolitan
Police Agency.

00:14:54.897 --> 00:14:59.064
Police are making every effort
to capture Inspector Jang,

00:14:59.104 --> 00:15:01.439
distributing wanted posters
with his picture and description.

00:15:04.772 --> 00:15:07.104
HOPE MOTEL

00:15:32.439 --> 00:15:35.104
Nov 11th, 1 am.
Masan Port, white cargo ship.

00:15:35.525 --> 00:15:36.731
Okay.

00:15:51.263 --> 00:15:53.651
Go round and round...

00:15:55.104 --> 00:15:57.480
Go round and round...

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.870
Are we going to be okay?

00:16:00.503 --> 00:16:02.538
If HQ finds out,
they'll be furious.

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.561
If higher-ups get involved,

00:16:04.592 --> 00:16:08.480
Inspector...
I mean, Taegu will never show.

00:16:08.584 --> 00:16:11.667
This is our case,
and we need to finish it.

00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:15.301
If anything happens,
I'll take full responsibility.

00:16:17.614 --> 00:16:21.147
You've changed, sir.

00:16:21.581 --> 00:16:23.531
Yeah?
I hope in a good way.

00:16:23.756 --> 00:16:27.798
If we lose him again,
we're all done. Stay sharp.

00:16:52.421 --> 00:16:54.675
Dad! Help me!

00:16:55.104 --> 00:16:57.815
Dad! Dad!

00:16:59.604 --> 00:17:02.432
If you want your son alive,
come now.

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:03.981
You know where this is, right?

00:18:00.564 --> 00:18:01.711
Where's Mingyo?

00:18:03.693 --> 00:18:05.194
Bring my son back!

00:18:11.856 --> 00:18:13.104
His mom took him.

00:18:25.023 --> 00:18:26.897
I'm sorry, Mingyo.

00:18:28.397 --> 00:18:29.814
Go now.

00:18:35.939 --> 00:18:37.450
They're departing today.

00:19:48.532 --> 00:19:50.282
Jang Taegu, drop your weapon.

00:19:53.104 --> 00:19:55.821
We're monitoring
his son's house and school,

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.314
and his ex-wife's workplace.

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:01.197
But Taegu's too smart not to know that.

00:20:02.454 --> 00:20:04.172
- So you're saying...
- Yes.

00:20:04.605 --> 00:20:08.480
Lure him out.
By any means necessary.

00:20:12.548 --> 00:20:13.881
Drop the gun!

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.381
Eunsoo.

00:20:31.681 --> 00:20:34.136
Mrs. Kang, don't provoke him!

00:20:37.104 --> 00:20:39.397
You don't deserve to raise a child.

00:20:40.104 --> 00:20:42.264
You'll never see Mingyo again.

00:20:47.303 --> 00:20:50.522
You'll rot in prison forever.

00:20:50.811 --> 00:20:52.394
Step back, Mrs. Kang.

00:20:53.746 --> 00:20:54.913
Mrs. Kang!

00:21:00.486 --> 00:21:02.605
- Inspector!
- Jang Taegu, drop it!

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:13.605
Don't move!

00:21:25.605 --> 00:21:27.480
Drop the gun, right now!

00:21:38.023 --> 00:21:39.104
Eunyoung!

00:21:50.272 --> 00:21:51.772
Open the door!

00:22:01.856 --> 00:22:04.104
- Call for ambulance and backup!
- Yes, sir!

00:22:54.104 --> 00:22:55.689
You've become a monster too.

00:25:36.281 --> 00:25:37.865
Eunsoo, are you okay?

00:26:38.064 --> 00:26:41.119
Shit... Look at us.

00:27:16.731 --> 00:27:18.104
No!

00:27:45.522 --> 00:27:47.147
No!

00:28:05.647 --> 00:28:07.522
No!

00:28:14.397 --> 00:28:17.272
Send a search team right now.

00:28:18.397 --> 00:28:20.023
Hurry!

00:28:51.856 --> 00:28:53.104
New inmate.

00:29:37.522 --> 00:29:38.814
Hello.

00:29:57.981 --> 00:30:02.272
IF YOU EVER READ THIS LETTER,
COULD YOU WRITE BACK?

00:30:06.522 --> 00:30:10.480
I HOPE YOU READ THIS.

00:30:13.439 --> 00:30:16.981
I LOVE YOU, SUA...

00:30:23.104 --> 00:30:26.480
YOU'RE MY MOST PRECIOUS GIFT.

00:30:32.314 --> 00:30:36.104
HOW ARE YOU DOING AT SCHOOL?

00:30:52.981 --> 00:30:55.939
I CAN'T WAIT TO HUG YOU AGAIN.

00:30:56.147 --> 00:31:00.230
ONE YEAR LATER

00:31:00.772 --> 00:31:02.397
Hey, over here!

00:31:33.104 --> 00:31:34.678
You got out sooner
than I expected.

00:31:34.936 --> 00:31:37.600
I won't lie,
I'm kind of feeling jealous.

00:31:40.803 --> 00:31:43.884
Don't look at me like that.
I have no regrets.

00:31:44.023 --> 00:31:46.166
Not even a little.

00:31:46.314 --> 00:31:51.314
I made more money too.
You did all the work.

00:31:53.318 --> 00:31:55.150
You really don't regret it?

00:31:56.268 --> 00:31:58.560
You had something
you absolutely had to do.

00:31:59.191 --> 00:32:02.083
I just wanted for once...

00:32:02.544 --> 00:32:05.104
to stop calculating and thinking,

00:32:06.376 --> 00:32:09.751
and just do something for you.

00:32:10.104 --> 00:32:13.104
You still have something left to protect.

00:32:13.647 --> 00:32:16.105
You should hurry and go meet Sua.

00:32:20.806 --> 00:32:24.528
If you cry now,
things will become really awkward.

00:32:32.542 --> 00:32:35.584
And again,
you still don't know me.

00:32:35.672 --> 00:32:38.772
Do I look like someone
who sacrifices for others?

00:32:45.147 --> 00:32:48.439
TWON GROUP - AI INDUSTRIAL PROJECT PLAN

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.105
Good afternoon. I'm Kang Hwirim,
Executive Director of TwoN Holdings.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.605
The AI industrial complex project
was the biggest highlight at our last IR.

00:33:01.647 --> 00:33:04.522
We hope today's presentation
meets your expectations.

00:33:04.564 --> 00:33:08.023
The introductory video
was generated by AI.

00:33:08.064 --> 00:33:09.023
Let's take a look.

00:33:12.689 --> 00:33:16.849
A trillion-won Project
Designing the future of AI in InSan

00:33:22.522 --> 00:33:23.772
Welcome.

00:33:24.939 --> 00:33:26.814
Firstly, the most essential component...

00:33:26.856 --> 00:33:29.314
I guess I'm not the only one
who's nervous.

00:33:29.689 --> 00:33:32.104
Here we develop AI algorithms,

00:33:32.104 --> 00:33:36.188
autonomous systems and robot testing,
AI tech development, and more.

00:33:36.814 --> 00:33:39.104
All ready to be deployed directly into...

00:33:39.104 --> 00:33:41.104
Vaka?
This is meth, right?

00:33:48.647 --> 00:33:51.564
This is incredible!
Where did you get this?

00:33:58.355 --> 00:34:00.064
- Block the screen!
- Block it now!

00:34:02.605 --> 00:34:04.647
Turn that video off!
Turn it off!

00:34:16.647 --> 00:34:18.064
Is the footage real?

00:34:18.104 --> 00:34:19.147
Please confirm the video's authenticity.

00:34:19.188 --> 00:34:21.104
Do you admit to drug use?

00:34:21.104 --> 00:34:22.856
Is there any connection
with government officials?

00:34:22.897 --> 00:34:24.605
Are you the person in the footage?

00:34:24.647 --> 00:34:27.188
- Is that you in the video?
- It's you, isn't it?

00:34:56.545 --> 00:35:00.901
Share your entire client list,
and we'll consider a reduced sentence.

00:35:02.714 --> 00:35:05.213
Prosecutor, have you heard
of 'The Fisherman'?

00:35:05.354 --> 00:35:09.147
He's the drug distributor that
the police have been chasing for years.

00:35:10.282 --> 00:35:15.856
I can give you even more.
So how about it?

00:36:06.023 --> 00:36:07.188
Is the footage real?

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.647
Please verify its authenticity.

00:36:08.689 --> 00:36:10.188
Do you admit to drug consumption?

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.104
Are any government officials involved?

00:36:12.104 --> 00:36:14.104
Could the video be manipulated?

00:37:18.104 --> 00:37:21.981
I don't know how you got free,
but it won't be for long.

00:37:22.147 --> 00:37:25.856
Malicious entrapment,
forced dosing, and video tampering.

00:37:25.897 --> 00:37:27.981
If you confess to everything,
I'll ask for leniency.

00:37:29.605 --> 00:37:32.104
- And if I refuse?
- You won't come out alive.

00:37:32.104 --> 00:37:33.564
And your family won't be safe.

00:37:33.605 --> 00:37:36.355
Your father has five guaranteed
completions next month.

00:37:36.397 --> 00:37:37.827
I can delay it for you.

00:37:37.843 --> 00:37:40.939
Do you know how much
a two-week delay will cost?

00:37:41.017 --> 00:37:44.320
Your father's company
would go bankrupt within a month.

00:37:49.722 --> 00:37:51.221
Is this how you did it before?

00:37:51.858 --> 00:37:55.065
When you killed my friend
ten years ago,

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.873
and pinned it all on me.

00:37:57.355 --> 00:37:59.272
It was an accident.

00:37:59.814 --> 00:38:02.772
An unfortunate and unlucky accident.

00:38:02.814 --> 00:38:07.397
Yeah, you did it,
and everyone else paid for it.

00:38:07.439 --> 00:38:10.355
Man, that was ages ago.

00:38:12.037 --> 00:38:13.454
You forget too easily.

00:38:13.472 --> 00:38:16.973
Too bad, though.
You failed at revenge.

00:38:16.998 --> 00:38:17.950
Drugs?

00:38:19.814 --> 00:38:21.397
Must I explain word by word?

00:38:22.981 --> 00:38:25.230
If you wanted to take down
my family company,

00:38:25.272 --> 00:38:29.104
you should've gotten
my gramps to do the drugs.

00:38:29.104 --> 00:38:34.397
A fuck up by an executive
won't make people sell TwoN shares.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:40.439
The stock dip after your stunt
was only a few thousand won!

00:38:41.451 --> 00:38:43.158
What a waste of time.

00:38:44.287 --> 00:38:47.328
I'm leaving.
Get ready to get screwed.

00:38:53.801 --> 00:38:58.206
You know, you people are
always so optimistic.

00:38:58.522 --> 00:39:02.747
You commit crimes
without any fear of paying the price.

00:39:02.871 --> 00:39:07.235
Do you think I did all that
merely to expose your drug addiction?

00:39:07.658 --> 00:39:10.985
What happened was just a preview.

00:39:11.243 --> 00:39:14.104
A TwoN heir's drug addiction
and indiscretion.

00:39:14.321 --> 00:39:18.188
It's bound to draw attention
even if you don't know TwoN.

00:39:18.211 --> 00:39:20.647
We got high
and ran into a problem.

00:39:20.689 --> 00:39:24.314
Nothing big, just a few candies.
Then one guy overdosed, right?

00:39:24.355 --> 00:39:27.439
Cops came, and I thought
we were all screwed.

00:39:28.009 --> 00:39:30.104
But only the dog took the fall.

00:39:30.447 --> 00:39:32.939
Only he ended up in jail.
Nice and neat.

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:34.147
Hope he's doing all right.

00:39:34.188 --> 00:39:37.104
What if this soon-to-be forgotten gossip

00:39:37.439 --> 00:39:41.104
escalates into a murder
committed by the company head?

00:39:41.104 --> 00:39:43.188
Kang Hwirim,
Executive Director of TwoN Holdings,

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:46.104
has been found to be
linked to a past murder,

00:39:46.105 --> 00:39:48.104
and police are set
to launch an investigation.

00:39:48.104 --> 00:39:51.397
The situation further escalated
after allegations of corruption

00:39:51.439 --> 00:39:55.856
by Kang Gunam, Chairman of TwoN,
newly emerged.

00:39:55.897 --> 00:39:57.564
Drug addict's company! Murder's company!

00:39:57.605 --> 00:39:59.564
Down with TwoN! Down with TwoN!

00:39:59.605 --> 00:40:04.104
Kang Gunam and his family
must step down!

00:40:04.104 --> 00:40:07.272
Once public opinion worsens,
the government will step in.

00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:11.104
The same government that
promised a trillion won funding.

00:40:11.564 --> 00:40:15.055
Bullshit. A decision like that
can't be canceled so easily!

00:40:17.237 --> 00:40:19.359
That was my original plan.

00:40:20.326 --> 00:40:22.035
But it doesn't matter anymore.

00:40:22.564 --> 00:40:27.814
All that matters
is that people believe it.

00:40:28.147 --> 00:40:29.314
Executive Kang...

00:40:33.355 --> 00:40:35.814
The stock-backed loans you took...

00:40:36.397 --> 00:40:40.104
If the share value drops, the collateral
gets sold at rock-bottom prices.

00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:44.560
If the closing price drops 30%
and the lower limit holds for three days,

00:40:44.583 --> 00:40:46.647
TwoN shares will plunge
below 100,000 won.

00:40:47.564 --> 00:40:48.982
So that's what you were after!

00:40:49.005 --> 00:40:51.355
Why do you think
I didn't blow it up all at once?

00:40:51.397 --> 00:40:55.689
For a little fire to become a big one,
it needs to be fueled.

00:40:55.868 --> 00:40:59.480
The government is set to review
whether it will continue funding

00:40:59.522 --> 00:41:01.314
the TwoN Holdings' projects,

00:41:01.355 --> 00:41:05.105
with some of them
set to be scrapped entirely.

00:41:05.147 --> 00:41:08.564
A source expressed worry
that TwoN Holdings may face

00:41:08.605 --> 00:41:13.439
major liquidity issues
if government fundings are pulled out.

00:41:23.397 --> 00:41:26.023
You need 30% shares
to form a defensive block.

00:41:26.455 --> 00:41:30.814
If you're short by 1%,
or even 0.5%,

00:41:30.856 --> 00:41:33.480
your precious company
will change hands.

00:41:36.355 --> 00:41:40.145
Who do you think holds that 0.5%?

00:41:41.023 --> 00:41:43.104
You bastard!

00:41:43.104 --> 00:41:44.104
I'll kill you!

00:42:01.774 --> 00:42:04.315
Come on, bark all you want.

00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:07.104
Who knows?
Maybe I'll show you mercy.

00:42:14.105 --> 00:42:17.326
Come on, please.
Let me talk to grandpa.

00:42:17.522 --> 00:42:20.064
He won't answer my calls!

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:23.605
I can make up for everything.
Just help me out here.

00:42:23.724 --> 00:42:26.731
The public's attention is too high.
We can't move rashly...

00:42:26.772 --> 00:42:29.104
Fuck you!
He can't abandon me!

00:42:29.104 --> 00:42:32.104
Shut up and put grandpa
on the line. Fuck!

00:42:32.104 --> 00:42:33.605
Fuck!

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.867
Hey! Where are you going?

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:56.492
Look at yourself.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.691
I don't want to be here.

00:43:06.023 --> 00:43:08.397
Hey! Hey!

00:43:08.439 --> 00:43:09.522
Hey!

00:43:11.814 --> 00:43:14.583
Seriously?
Are you mocking me too?

00:43:15.147 --> 00:43:16.981
You're scaring me.

00:43:17.023 --> 00:43:20.251
I treated you well,
yet you betray me?

00:43:33.023 --> 00:43:36.605
Stop pretending and get up.
Get up now!

00:43:57.104 --> 00:43:59.105
Grandpa, it wasn't me!

00:43:59.981 --> 00:44:03.104
Grandpa!
Grandpa, please save me!

00:44:03.104 --> 00:44:04.731
Grandpa!

00:44:05.355 --> 00:44:06.605
Grandpa!

00:44:12.647 --> 00:44:15.856
Kang Hwirim, who is under investigation
for drug use and mediation,

00:44:16.105 --> 00:44:18.480
has been arrested
on charges of negligent injury.

00:44:18.981 --> 00:44:22.104
The victim has been identified
as Yoo Misun, Kang's girlfriend,

00:44:22.105 --> 00:44:26.104
and a well-known influencer
with 2 million followers.

00:44:26.104 --> 00:44:29.272
Police have also begun a reinvestigation
into the drug-related death

00:44:29.314 --> 00:44:34.230
of a male at Kang's villa ten years ago,
following a recently found recording.

00:44:34.564 --> 00:44:39.104
TwoN's Kang Gunam, under suspicion
for evidence tampering and concealment,

00:44:39.104 --> 00:44:41.104
rejected the allegations of all...

00:44:41.105 --> 00:44:44.104
I offer my deepest apologies.

00:44:44.213 --> 00:44:47.213
What I can say for certain is that

00:44:47.689 --> 00:44:50.939
this is solely an issue of
former Executive Director Kang Hwirim,

00:44:50.981 --> 00:44:57.104
and any allegations of my involvement
from ten years ago are absolutely untrue.

00:44:57.522 --> 00:45:03.897
TwoN will fully cooperate with the
investigation into the former executive...

00:45:03.939 --> 00:45:07.314
TwoN Holdings' stock has plunged
as the company faces controversy,

00:45:07.355 --> 00:45:09.104
fueling investor worries.

00:45:09.104 --> 00:45:14.023
The crisis may weigh on
TwoN Group's overall stock,

00:45:14.064 --> 00:45:16.480
attracting increased investor scrutiny.

00:45:38.411 --> 00:45:41.250
I told you,
sacrificing isn't my thing.

00:45:41.771 --> 00:45:44.633
I went by your house,
but no one was there.

00:45:45.104 --> 00:45:46.856
Are you staying here now?

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:50.089
Yeah.

00:45:51.252 --> 00:45:52.252
How's your health?

00:45:52.974 --> 00:45:55.456
Have you seen your family?

00:45:56.088 --> 00:45:59.206
Gosh, you haven't changed one bit.

00:46:00.542 --> 00:46:03.751
I came straight here
to give you this.

00:46:20.564 --> 00:46:23.480
Thank you.
You made my plan succeed.

00:46:23.522 --> 00:46:27.998
I got these by liquidating the shares.
There was quite a bit left.

00:46:28.104 --> 00:46:30.104
I'm paying you back with interest.

00:46:31.814 --> 00:46:34.856
Have you seen Sua again?

00:46:40.392 --> 00:46:43.408
Is there anything I can help with?

00:46:43.871 --> 00:46:45.454
If there's anything I can do...

00:46:48.355 --> 00:46:50.731
Hurry, hurry!

00:46:59.104 --> 00:47:01.314
Eunsoo! Get out of here!

00:47:05.397 --> 00:47:07.104
Sua, are you okay?

00:47:09.104 --> 00:47:11.023
Eunsoo, run!

00:47:14.287 --> 00:47:16.871
Keep this up, and you'll never
see your daughter again.

00:47:17.936 --> 00:47:19.227
Your life is screwed.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.314
They still haven't found Jang Taegu.

00:47:23.539 --> 00:47:26.314
You know,
if you really want...

00:47:26.355 --> 00:47:27.439
I don't want anything.

00:47:27.604 --> 00:47:31.257
I've already gotten plenty from you.
It's enough.

00:47:33.856 --> 00:47:35.814
I should've never started.

00:47:35.856 --> 00:47:39.644
Still, I'm really glad I did it with you.

00:47:42.104 --> 00:47:44.856
I hope you live well.

00:47:44.897 --> 00:47:48.939
And put everything we did
all behind us.

00:47:57.166 --> 00:47:58.166
Kyung.

00:47:59.897 --> 00:48:01.104
Be happy.

00:48:15.816 --> 00:48:19.181
Yes, I'll be happy.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:21.480
So that you won't worry.

00:48:22.025 --> 00:48:26.318
So you have to be happy too, okay?

00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:28.147
So I won't worry.

00:48:29.064 --> 00:48:30.104
Okay.

00:48:47.104 --> 00:48:48.230
I'll go now.

00:49:26.733 --> 00:49:28.483
Let's give up on Jang Taegu.

00:49:29.522 --> 00:49:32.397
- It's been over a year.
- I'm giving up after today.

00:49:32.525 --> 00:49:34.202
You said that last week.

00:49:35.564 --> 00:49:36.772
Hello?

00:49:36.814 --> 00:49:37.897
Yes, that's right.

00:49:39.639 --> 00:49:40.806
Really?

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:44.406
I think they found
Jang Taegu's body.

00:49:45.581 --> 00:49:47.415
Yes, we'll come right away.

00:49:54.419 --> 00:49:55.497
I'm sorry...

00:49:57.104 --> 00:49:58.470
...for deceiving you.

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:03.376
Doing it with you made me
feel a little less guilty.

00:50:04.814 --> 00:50:06.023
I'm really sorry.

00:50:06.564 --> 00:50:11.439
Whether we knew it or not,
we still did it.

00:50:13.856 --> 00:50:14.981
How are you doing?

00:50:15.981 --> 00:50:17.457
The foster home is better.

00:50:17.489 --> 00:50:20.104
I can stretch my legs when I sleep,

00:50:20.104 --> 00:50:21.480
and my Mom's boyfriend isn't there.

00:50:22.104 --> 00:50:25.104
By the way,
Jinhee's parents didn't divorce.

00:50:25.371 --> 00:50:26.907
They're moving to the countryside.

00:50:27.814 --> 00:50:28.856
I see.

00:50:29.492 --> 00:50:33.104
What happened between
you and your mom?

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.503
Don't hate her for too long.

00:50:42.605 --> 00:50:44.272
I kind of understand your mom.

00:50:45.392 --> 00:50:48.266
I just hope it hurts you less.

00:51:26.592 --> 00:51:27.931
Eunsoo?

00:51:35.678 --> 00:51:37.012
When did you get out?

00:51:38.182 --> 00:51:39.424
A little while ago.

00:51:42.338 --> 00:51:48.244
Thank you for taking care of Sua.
Once I find a place to stay...

00:51:48.275 --> 00:51:51.439
Your brother-in-law
refused her back then.

00:51:51.588 --> 00:51:53.704
So now, I'm Sua's legal guardian.

00:51:54.209 --> 00:51:55.634
Sua agreed to it.

00:52:00.321 --> 00:52:03.852
I heard you took my husband
to the hospital that day.

00:52:05.104 --> 00:52:08.564
And was it you that reported me?

00:52:10.008 --> 00:52:14.272
After everything, is that
what you're curious about?

00:52:17.876 --> 00:52:20.376
Was I ever a friend to you?

00:52:21.064 --> 00:52:24.921
Yes, I liked you so much
that I wanted to be you.

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:28.155
Not anymore, though.

00:52:29.772 --> 00:52:31.421
Don't come without contacting me.

00:52:31.897 --> 00:52:32.856
Yeoju!

00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:37.689
Sua doesn't draw anymore.
Actually, she can't draw.

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:40.023
Her bones healed,
but it still pains her.

00:52:40.064 --> 00:52:42.856
They say it's psychogenic.
And I'm not surprised.

00:54:15.033 --> 00:54:19.034
I admired how hard you worked
to better your life.

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:22.201
That's why I married you.

00:54:22.468 --> 00:54:23.609
I'll wait for you.

00:54:24.147 --> 00:54:26.230
If people curse us,
we'll hear it together.

00:54:26.272 --> 00:54:28.188
If they throw stones,
we'll take them together.

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:32.135
If the three of us are together,
we'll be okay.

00:54:37.272 --> 00:54:38.397
Honey...

00:54:38.439 --> 00:54:40.731
I lost everyone I loved.

00:54:41.272 --> 00:54:42.689
I never...

00:54:44.472 --> 00:54:45.848
...want to see you again.

00:55:24.314 --> 00:55:25.689
Honey.

00:55:30.188 --> 00:55:31.188
Honey.

00:55:49.731 --> 00:55:51.104
You've been through a lot.

00:55:55.402 --> 00:55:58.140
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

00:56:04.843 --> 00:56:05.843
Son.

00:56:10.213 --> 00:56:11.213
Welcome home.

00:57:02.772 --> 00:57:04.480
Welcome back, little brother.

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.702
TO LEE KYUNG

00:58:38.933 --> 00:58:40.808
All set?

00:58:40.897 --> 00:58:43.188
- Yes.
- We'll depart then.

00:58:50.023 --> 00:58:51.439
55, HAENGBOK-RO 32-GIL

00:59:14.104 --> 00:59:16.230
That's one firm grip.

00:59:16.272 --> 00:59:19.897
Damn, it won't come out.

00:59:20.439 --> 00:59:24.023
Considering the climate
and the lack of insect traces,

00:59:24.685 --> 00:59:27.547
the time of death
was probably last winter.

00:59:27.731 --> 00:59:31.397
You rushed me, so I checked
dental records first. They matched.

00:59:32.023 --> 00:59:33.314
It's Jang Taegu, alright.

00:59:37.188 --> 00:59:39.272
The body had a bulletproof vest on,

00:59:39.314 --> 00:59:42.104
with no fractures in the sternum.

00:59:42.104 --> 00:59:43.981
It's unlikely he died of a gunshot.

00:59:45.856 --> 00:59:47.494
So what's his cause of death?

00:59:47.526 --> 00:59:51.188
Seeing the weapon mark
on the right femur,

00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:54.193
it was likely sepsis or
massive bleeding from the wound.

00:59:54.243 --> 00:59:56.159
But proving it
from this state is difficult.

00:59:57.689 --> 01:00:00.355
He didn't let go of the bag
even upon death.

01:00:01.104 --> 01:00:04.147
I don't know if that's
tenacious or pathetic.

01:00:50.573 --> 01:00:52.015
I won, you bastards.

01:00:53.772 --> 01:00:55.897
I won, you bastards!

01:01:28.174 --> 01:01:29.252
Mingyo.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.384
Daddy won.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.647
Just wait.
Just a little bit.

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:39.759
I'll come get you.

01:02:32.981 --> 01:02:36.981
Do you really think I caused
that woman to go that far?

01:02:38.986 --> 01:02:44.237
Wrong. That woman would've
eventually killed someone.

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:47.454
It doesn't matter the cause.

01:02:47.605 --> 01:02:52.444
Once it starts,
there's always a next step.

01:02:55.689 --> 01:03:00.104
That's what living is.

01:03:00.448 --> 01:03:03.156
You and I are the same.

01:03:51.314 --> 01:03:52.981
Here are today's top stories.

01:03:53.355 --> 01:03:57.104
The skeletal remains
found on Mount Suo were identified

01:03:57.104 --> 01:03:59.939
as the former Inspector Jang Taegu.

01:03:59.981 --> 01:04:04.564
Jang was wanted for drug trafficking
and murdering fellow officers.

01:04:04.605 --> 01:04:06.772
The location of the discovered body

01:04:06.814 --> 01:04:10.522
is said to match
Jang's last known whereabouts.

01:04:10.772 --> 01:04:13.355
Police plan to continue the investigation

01:04:13.397 --> 01:04:17.731
to determine the precise
cause of his death.

01:04:31.064 --> 01:04:33.605
HANSEL AND GRETEL

01:04:46.856 --> 01:04:51.147
Gretel shoved the witch hard
into the oven.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:55.772
- Can't you do it right?
- I'm sorry.

01:04:56.605 --> 01:04:58.230
- Calves.
- Calves!

01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:02.355
I was the manager
at a massage parlor.

01:05:02.397 --> 01:05:03.897
Good, I'm counting on you.

01:05:04.689 --> 01:05:06.147
- The other leg.
- Sure.

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:33.064
Damn, it's too cold.

01:05:36.522 --> 01:05:37.772
Shit.

01:05:39.104 --> 01:05:42.104
Hey, rookie! Lie straight!

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:43.272
Freaking nutcase.

01:05:45.064 --> 01:05:48.105
What the fuck!
Call the guard! The guard!

01:05:48.147 --> 01:05:50.023
- Call anyone!
- Guard! Guard!

01:05:50.638 --> 01:05:51.541
Guard!

01:05:51.588 --> 01:05:55.104
The witch burned to death,
screaming terribly,

01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:59.355
and the siblings returned
with her treasure and lived happily.

01:05:59.981 --> 01:06:03.647
I don't see any issues.
Let's proceed with the contract.

01:06:03.689 --> 01:06:04.532
Okay.

01:06:06.522 --> 01:06:09.104
Where did the contract
from the developer go?

01:06:09.104 --> 01:06:12.023
It's in my study,
next to the safe.

01:06:12.104 --> 01:06:13.104
Ah, okay.

01:06:13.104 --> 01:06:15.272
No, stay.
I'll bring it.

01:06:16.314 --> 01:06:17.314
Thanks.

01:06:17.944 --> 01:06:21.443
Did they really live happily ever after?

01:07:03.064 --> 01:07:04.314
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

01:07:11.082 --> 01:07:12.040
What's wrong?

01:07:20.597 --> 01:07:21.556
Father?

01:07:47.266 --> 01:07:48.453
What is this?

01:07:53.189 --> 01:07:57.019
Why did you make
this agreement with TwoN?

01:08:02.605 --> 01:08:06.397
JOINT CONTRACT. "NEVER DISCLOSE
AND KEEP SECRET PERMANENTLY."

01:08:06.939 --> 01:08:08.023
What does all this mean?

01:08:09.104 --> 01:08:11.897
NOVEMBER, 2011...

01:08:13.104 --> 01:08:15.230
That's when Kyung's friend died.

01:08:17.181 --> 01:08:19.016
What is it?

01:08:22.150 --> 01:08:24.647
If I were the real murderer,

01:08:26.263 --> 01:08:30.841
TwoN would never have offered
this contract, right?

01:08:31.056 --> 01:08:33.140
Dad, don't tell me...

01:08:34.755 --> 01:08:37.355
Did you agree to framing
Kyung for the murder?

01:08:38.206 --> 01:08:39.470
Say you didn't.

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:42.814
You didn't, right?

01:08:42.856 --> 01:08:46.147
Kyung, this is...

01:08:46.188 --> 01:08:47.897
Say you didn't!

01:08:49.649 --> 01:08:51.327
I had no choice back then.

01:08:52.023 --> 01:08:53.999
The company was
about to collapse.

01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:56.939
I couldn't let the whole family die
because of you.

01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:59.584
I had to make the better choice.

01:09:05.237 --> 01:09:07.073
Which was to sell me out?

01:09:07.104 --> 01:09:08.981
It's all in the past.

01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:12.777
What's the point of
digging it up now?

01:09:14.135 --> 01:09:15.149
What's the point?

01:09:17.522 --> 01:09:19.814
Do you know how
I've lived all this time?

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:22.023
If I put everything back...

01:09:22.772 --> 01:09:24.522
If I make those bastards pay...

01:09:26.772 --> 01:09:29.064
I thought you'd finally believe me.

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:33.439
Even when I wanted to
die from misery,

01:09:34.678 --> 01:09:37.094
that single hope kept me going.

01:09:39.518 --> 01:09:41.310
Are you really asking
what the point is?

01:09:43.814 --> 01:09:46.939
Who told you to do it?
I never told you.

01:09:47.897 --> 01:09:50.647
Why were you there at that time?

01:09:50.847 --> 01:09:55.605
Why did you get entangled with them
and make my life this hard?

01:09:55.647 --> 01:09:57.397
- Father!
- What?

01:09:58.981 --> 01:10:00.689
You little brat!

01:10:01.311 --> 01:10:04.104
So you abandoned me back then.

01:10:04.104 --> 01:10:06.439
And all this time,
I didn't know.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.689
Kyung!

01:10:10.605 --> 01:10:14.480
Fine. Kill me.
Go on.

01:10:54.275 --> 01:10:55.178
Kyung.

01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:04.345
Kyung!

01:11:07.542 --> 01:11:08.853
Kyung!

01:11:10.104 --> 01:11:11.188
Good work.

01:11:11.605 --> 01:11:12.939
Yes, thank you.

01:11:21.104 --> 01:11:24.946
Boss, I thought it was
1.8 million a month.

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:28.104
Be grateful for what you've got.

01:11:30.618 --> 01:11:32.001
You're an ex-convict.

01:11:33.439 --> 01:11:35.355
If you don't like it, quit.

01:12:39.439 --> 01:12:43.981
Were the siblings okay
after shoving the witch into the oven?

01:13:13.439 --> 01:13:15.939
To my beloved daughter Sua.

01:13:16.564 --> 01:13:23.104
Sua, as I write this letter,
snow is piling up silently outside.

01:13:23.564 --> 01:13:26.981
You always loved this season.

01:13:27.272 --> 01:13:32.272
I can picture you running around
in the piled-up snow.

01:13:32.647 --> 01:13:35.522
I don't know where to begin.

01:13:35.789 --> 01:13:42.647
Not long after your dad collapsed,
I found the drug bag at home.

01:13:44.104 --> 01:13:45.314
I didn't know what to do,

01:13:45.731 --> 01:13:48.731
but I convinced myself in desperation

01:13:49.105 --> 01:13:53.772
to do whatever it takes
to protect our family.

01:13:54.605 --> 01:13:57.104
I know I don't deserve forgiveness.

01:13:57.898 --> 01:13:59.230
But my dear Sua,

01:13:59.731 --> 01:14:02.547
even if you never forgive me,

01:14:03.104 --> 01:14:05.856
I want you to forgive yourself.

01:14:06.188 --> 01:14:09.104
So don't give up on anything.

01:14:09.605 --> 01:14:12.856
I wish you'd no longer lose
what's precious to you.

01:14:14.647 --> 01:14:17.104
You will always be my daughter.

01:14:18.105 --> 01:14:22.314
Don't forget that I'm always
thinking of you.

01:14:23.041 --> 01:14:25.041
You're never alone.

01:14:25.647 --> 01:14:29.105
I will love you until the end of time,

01:14:29.939 --> 01:14:33.105
and I will always wait for you.

01:14:49.897 --> 01:14:52.104
Watch where you're going!

01:14:53.428 --> 01:14:54.355
Excuse me!

01:14:54.397 --> 01:14:56.104
Sorry.

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:12.605
Crazy bastard,
you wanna die?

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:20.314
Fucking lunatic.

01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:08.355
BRO

01:16:58.023 --> 01:17:01.104
Can a person who has once
crossed the line

01:17:03.023 --> 01:17:04.897
truly resist crossing it again

01:17:05.397 --> 01:17:08.104
when faced with the same situation?

01:18:00.814 --> 01:18:03.981
SUA

01:19:13.104 --> 01:19:15.939
