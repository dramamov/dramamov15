(Yet His Feelings for You
Transcend Kinship)

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.320
Consort Jing has arrived!

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.448
Consort Jing.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.880
What's this about?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.240
Your Majesty,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.360
I accuse Ling Yun of entering the palace
under a stolen identity

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.400
for malicious intentions.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.640
A stolen identity?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.840
Yes.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.040
Ling Yun is an alias.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.000
Her true identity

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.040
is the former dynasty's princess.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.960
Former dynasty's princess?

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.384
Wu Linfu.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.736
The exile mark

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.160
was used
by the former dynasty's noblewomen.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.280
Take a look.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.560
Have you seen her?

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.360
Well?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.760
Do you recognize me?

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.856
No.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.224
It's not you.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.560
No?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.360
How could it not be?

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.320
This consort is indeed not
the adopted daughter of our Bi family.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.760
Wu Linfu,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.960
you claim the former princess
hides within the harem.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.040
Since Ling Yun isn't her,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.360
then who is?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.800
Bi An.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.520
It's you!

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.224
You are...

00:01:56.224 --> 00:01:57.160
You are...

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.000
Your Majesty,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.840
she is!

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.800
She is!

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.280
Speak plainly.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.440
Your Majesty,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.240
she looks exactly
like our adopted daughter.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.120
You're lying!

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.560
I wouldn't dare lie.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.960
She truly is that former princess!

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.960
Impudent wretch!

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.760
How dare you slander me!

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.560
Do you know this is a capital offense?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.480
Your Majesty,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.360
I would never dare deceive you.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.840
This consort
is that very adopted daughter.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.800
It's absolutely true.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.736
You vile wretch!

00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:25.920
Framing me with nonsense!

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.760
Enough!

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.120
Noble Lady Mu,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.560
do you truly think I know nothing?

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.120
I secretly investigated your background.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.040
I refrained from exposing you

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.320
just to see how long you'd keep acting.

00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:40.720
Guards!

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.760
Arrest Noble Lady Mu!

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.800
So you've suspected me all along.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.160
And I exhausted myself
pretending affection with you.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
I should've killed you long ago!

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.480
I never imagined

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.160
that the one sharing my bed nightly

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.560
plotted my death daily.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.560
Tyrant! You're unfit to rule!

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.600
I regret not devouring
your flesh and blood!

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.400
Take her away.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.960
Throw her in the dungeon.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.792
Your Majesty,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.040
Consort Jing

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.080
called me a rebel.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.720
Now that Noble Lady Mu's identity
is exposed,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.520
I have questions

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.320
for Consort Jing.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.920
What else do you wish to ask?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.120
You condemned me as a rebel
based on a dagger.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.440
Here are my questions.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.400
Where did this dagger come from?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.360
Were you involved

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.320
in the Bi family massacre years ago?

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.800
I've never been to Qiongzhou.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.160
Don't make baseless accusations.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.120
Even if you didn't orchestrate

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.040
the massacre,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.040
you've always known

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.080
Consort Wan's background
as a Yangzhou entertainer.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.240
You threatened her with her indenture

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.440
to obtain that dagger.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.000
You abused your power

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.480
and watched Consort Wan
destroy the Bi family,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.688
all to

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.040
gain leverage over her

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.640
and protect your position.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.920
To hide your secrets,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.840
you released rebels,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.240
endangering His Majesty.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.440
What excuses do you have?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.760
Preposterous lies!

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.560
Your Majesty,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.800
she's slandering me.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.416
His Majesty,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.520
during my time in the palace,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.560
open attacks and hidden schemes
swarmed at me.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.360
To protect myself,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.560
I had to investigate why these people

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.000
persistently see me
as a thorn in their side.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.920
If Your Majesty doubts this,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.160
you may send someone to verify.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.360
Every word I've spoken

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.320
is truthful.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.912
Go investigate.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.960
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.960
Your Majesty...

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.080
Spare me your excuses.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.800
I've stripped you of your empress title.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.800
I won't act further against you,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.560
but I never wish to see you again.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.400
Return to Jinghe Palace.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.520
Reflect deeply on your actions.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.520
His Majesty has restored your rank.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.040
Have you come to flaunt it before me?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.200
There are no winners between us.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.120
What's there to flaunt?

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.360
You've won Wu Linfu's heart.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.120
Isn't that enough for you?

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.520
Slaughtering each other to fight

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.720
over a man's affection.

00:06:09.216 --> 00:06:10.160
Is it worthwhile?

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.160
Of course, it is.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.560
I watched Wu Linfu grow up.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.680
We understood each other best.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.800
When we entered the palace together,

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.000
I thought we'd comfort each other

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.360
in the palace.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.280
But instead, he distanced himself
for fear of my consort status,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.320
growing ever more distant.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.360
He did it to protect you.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.560
Right.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.800
He'd always protected me in secret.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.600
But everything changed when you arrived.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.160
He poured all his attention into you.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.360
I vanished from his sight.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.560
You know well

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.840
we're siblings.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.160
Yet his feelings for you
transcend kinship.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.840
The way he looks at you

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.120
is nothing I've ever seen.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.288
Never before.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.840
So you targeted me at every turn

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.360
to destroy me completely?

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.560
Without removing you,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.280
how could he return to me?

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.760
A forced fruit is bitter.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.920
This path wouldn't win him back

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.360
and has cost you everything.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.360
Now facing such consequences,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.360
do you feel no regret?

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.360
I'm fully aware.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.440
But there's no going back for us.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.344
Ling Yun,

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.720
you're his sister.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.360
You know him best, don't you?

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.888
Tell me,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.040
what should I do?

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.600
What exactly must I do

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.760
to bring him back to me?

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.680
Tell me.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.960
For the wrong man,

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.320
you've sacrificed dignity,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.720
morality,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.200
and nearly your life.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.760
It isn't worth it.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.280
Consort Jing,

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.560
think carefully

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.920
and stop deluding yourself.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.360
What brings you here?

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.680
I was wrong about you.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.680
I came to apologize.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.856
What I mean is,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.616
the night dew is heavy.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.240
You should

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.240
have someone summon me.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.960
Rest assured,

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.160
His Majesty gives me freedom

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.280
to move about.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.240
What's with Noble Lady Mu?

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.080
Nothing special.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.200
She's a remnant of the former dynasty,

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.920
being captured after being exposed.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.200
What more could it be?

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.920
She's the child
of a loyal former minister,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.920
not a remnant princess.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.864
Right?

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.144
How do you know this?

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.960
I'm not a fool.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.600
Everything proceeded too smoothly.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.360
I know my uncle's character well.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.840
He is timid and cautious.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.760
He couldn't have dared

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.320
commit perjury before His Majesty.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.720
You arranged everything

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.600
behind the scenes.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.272
Right?

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.520
This is the best possible outcome.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.632
Don't you agree?

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.360
Stop digging deeper.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.960
You're fortunate to have kept your life.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.760
Am I

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.160
that princess?

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.080
So you figured it out long ago.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.160
But your identity crisis
has been resolved.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.360
No one can confirm
your true status anymore.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.960
Everything has settled.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.120
When the time comes,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.800
I'll help you escape the palace.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.520
I can't simply sit back without a care.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.840
There's still much I must do.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.200
Do you intend to compete
with other consorts

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.400
for His Majesty's favor?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.240
Though Noble Lady Mu and I
had our disagreements,

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.960
she didn't deserve death.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.608
To help me,

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.760
she took the blame,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.328
aiming to die for me.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.400
How can I find peace

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.920
while enjoying safety
bought with her life?

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.760
She's in peril.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.960
By duty and conscience,
I can't abandon her.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.800
I will save her.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.240
If someone must escape the palace,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.480
it should be Noble Lady Mu,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.840
not me.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.920
In your heart,

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.680
am I less important than Noble Lady Mu?

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.800
Are you now

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.000
even jealous over Noble Lady Mu?

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.800
Of course not.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.800
But Noble Lady Mu

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.920
is from a loyal ministerial family
of the former dynasty.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.520
Moreover, she knows

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.160
you're their princess.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.520
Seeing you in such peril,

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.160
she willingly took the blame for you.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.280
She never asked anything in return.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.160
Therefore,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.360
you shouldn't take such risks.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.240
Also, she told me

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.840
she's already attained what she desired.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.992
What did she desire?
