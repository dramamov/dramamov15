[Episode 13]

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.390
If word of Blood River spreads

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.660
across the jianghu,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.130
then we, with nowhere to go,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.330
will make Tianqi City

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.840
our first stop.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.330
Maybe the world won't have us,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.850
but we'll...

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.770
erase the Shadow Sect from this world.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.010
Fine young man...

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.940
gutsy,

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.220
sharp,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.940
and skilled.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.780
The moment he walked in,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.220
he sensed you were here.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.890
Didn't you try

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.980
to hide your aura?

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.500
You were wrong.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.890
Before he entered,

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.690
I used the Breath-Concealing Art

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.260
to fully conceal

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.500
every trace of my aura.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.060
His skills are high.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.610
So young,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.870
and already beyond

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.960
the last Su family head.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.940
If you plan to rein them in,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.610
judging by the Shadow Sect today,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.610
His Highness will be disappointed.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.130
Yi Bu,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.730
show some real skill.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.610
This is the Wanjuan Tower.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.750
[Wanjuan Tower]

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.890
In this residence,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.610
it's the most heavily guarded.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.540
To get inside,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.220
I must draw those experts away.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.810
Uncle Zhe,

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.490
you're here.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.250
On my way,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.340
I got your message to the Patriarch.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.220
So...

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.460
we really plan to kill the Prince of Langya?

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.370
Back in Blood River,

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.410
that isn't a contract

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.780
I'd ever take.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.100
Besides,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.370
he's of the Xiao imperial line,

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.540
first in three generations.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.370
He's not an easy kill.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.810
What's your plan?

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.140
First we'll pretend to bargain with the Shadow Sect.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.370
We have to visit the Wanjuan Tower.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.660
We must find a way

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.100
to shatter the Shadow Sect in one strike,

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.850
then pull away

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.140
most of their forces,

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.610
enter Wanjuan Tower,

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.780
and destroy every record

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.610
on Blood River.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.340
That way,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.140
Blood River can be a guild

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.490
born and raised in the jianghu.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.460
Yi Bu wants to use us

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.490
to kill the Prince of Langya.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.580
That means he's scared.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.340
So we'll do

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.340
the opposite:

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.370
use the Prince of Langya

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.810
to wipe out the Shadow Sect.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.100
I thought the battle at Jiuxiao City

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.290
was the end of it all.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.980
After surviving this time,

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.460
will there be another hurdle?

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.250
Where there are people,

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.540
there's a jianghu.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.610
Where there's a jianghu,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.250
there's conflict.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.610
Besides,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.100
you've got a brother who loves a good fight.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.810
When will he arrive?

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.700
I've already sent word

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.580
about Tianqi City.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.370
Once he's ready,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.930
he'll enter Tianqi.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.020
In that case,

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.900
we'll wait a few days.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.020
Compared to us,

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.110
that Shadow Sect lot

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.700
won't be sitting easy.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.520
Since we're in Tianqi,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.050
I'll take you around

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.290
to some fun spots.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.660
The most famous places in Tianqi City?

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.780
I've made the rounds these days.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.930
Oh yeah? Which ones?

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.490
Thousand-Gold Tower,

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.270
the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.170
the Heaven-Querying Stone,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.050
Dragon-Ascending Garden.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.780
I even stopped by the academy.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.980
Hold it.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.100
What kind of boring spots are those?

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.170
They're the most famous sites

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.220
in all of Tianqi City.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.930
When it comes

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.900
to the truly famous place,

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.210
it should be...

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.120
The Imperial Palace?

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.610
The Entertainment Street.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.030
Su Changhe?

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.020
What brings you here?

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.370
I'm going to find Su Muyu.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.220
Want to come along?

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.040
- Kites! - Fresh buns!

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.800
- Kites for sale! - Take a look!

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.720
Kites in every style!

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.480
Muyu,

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.100
you come all the way to Tianqi

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.730
and don't even stroll through here?

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.900
I...

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.580
I don't know the way.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:30.980
Fair point.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.730
A place like this,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.170
you'll always get lost alone.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:35.660
Before lust can bewitch you,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.610
you're already lost here.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:39.460
Uncle Zhe...

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.220
how come you started drinking?

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.980
Because it makes me look dashing.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.810
How come so fluent

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.850
in standard speech now?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.540
Why do you care?

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.850
Then Uncle Zhe,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.250
where are we going

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.460
next from here?

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.250
At Pleasure House flowers bloom,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.780
when they bloom beauties arrive.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.050
Of course, we're going to Pleasure House.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:17.620
[Pleasure House]

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.170
Uncle Zhe,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.220
you really set me up.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.540
You didn't tell me

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.960
it's this kind of place!

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.050
Sir!

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.400
A cup from a beauty

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.820
is surely the finest wine.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.530
Sir...

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.060
[Pleasure House]

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.530
Uncle Zhe,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.120
what now?

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.190
What do we do?

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.420
What do you want to do?

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.610
I want to leave.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.370
Is this your first time here, Sir?

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:15.610
Yes.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.980
For a gentleman like you

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.010
to grace my place,

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.770
you shall have whatever you desire.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.730
Today,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.220
do whatever you please here,

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.250
and you won't have to pay

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.370
a single tael.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.370
What would you like to do?

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.890
I already said it.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.340
I want to leave.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.010
You want to leave?

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:41.460
But...

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.060
the uncle beside you

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.250
seems keen to stay.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.730
Muyu,

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.220
we're already here,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.300
so enjoy yourself.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.650
How about going in to hear a tune?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.580
I don't mind

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.610
you sipping the priciest wine

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.200
or choosing the prettiest girl.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.370
I only worry when you ask for music.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.790
The last one who came for a tune

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.440
was Xueyue City's Third City Lord,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.600
Sikong Changfeng.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.570
He walked off

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.060
with my top-earning girl.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.530
You're teasing me.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.340
But Sir,

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.980
today,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.580
it hasn't even rained outside.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.010
So why bring an umbrella?

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.650
I'm guessing

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.130
it's your weapon.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.300
To enjoy music here,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.610
no weapons inside.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.180
Let me hold it for you.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.430
Second Master, perfect timing.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.750
Come give me a hand

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.690
with our new friend.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.580
Sure!

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.420
This way, please!

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:53.890
Go on.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.100

[Pleasure House]

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.210
Here.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.940
Have a seat.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.070
[Wan'er of Pleasure House]

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.240
Mr. Jiang, you're right...

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.250
I'm Tu Wan of Thousand-Gold Tower.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.690
[Tu Wan of Thousand-Gold Tower]
May I ask your name?

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.100
Su Muyu.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.980
Muyu...

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.300
Good name!

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.340
A fine name indeed!

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.250
Su Muyu, the Umbrella Ghost?

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.700
Today I'm just Su Muyu here,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.310
not the "Umbrella Ghost".

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.670
Don't worry.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.340
I'm just here to enjoy the music.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.300
Ah, Mr. Su...

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.130
such tasteful leisure!

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.820
[Tianqi]

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.060
I wonder

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.730
what Su Muyu

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.340
is up to now.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.570
Mr. Chang, another cup.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:30.720
Come on!

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.630
Drink up!

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.590
This tune today is truly good!

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.100
Worth the trip...

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.940
Do you often visit for music?

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.180
I used to.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.720
Back then Miss Feng, a true virtuoso,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.580
held court here.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.530
Since Miss Feng left,

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:48.980
I haven't come for a long time.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.100
Now the one at the zither is Miss Wan'er.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.190
They said

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.850
her playing isn't beneath Miss Feng's.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:55.850
So I came to listen.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.060
How does it feel?

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.770
In my heart

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.250
she still falls short of Miss Feng,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.450
but indeed

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.150
she's already remarkable.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.160
What do you think?

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.260
As for music,

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.010
I only appreciate it.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:16.840
I have no standing

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.840
to judge others.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:19.250
I...

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.820
Let's talk later,

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.490
or Miss Wan'er will be upset.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.820
Seems this "top assassin"

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.490
isn't so terrifying.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.020
He even feels quite friendly.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.700
Maybe the rumors

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:42.850
exaggerate too much,

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.100
or only if he draws his blade

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.180
he turns into a demon.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.580
Forget it.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.420
Let me enjoy the music.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.010
I'll slip out when there's a chance.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.650
Where did you pick up

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.530
such a handsome young lad,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.580
and so brave, too?

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.530
Look how he's hooked

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.530
the hearts of our girls.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.490
He's a junior of mine.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.180
I want to see

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.100
if he's a reliable man.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:15.980
What,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.850
does making merry in my house

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.570
mean he isn't reliable?

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.460
Why test a man on that?

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.780
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.660
I've found my daughter.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.200
That's wonderful.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.300
Isn't that what you've wished for

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.530
all these years?

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.100
It is.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.490
But ever since

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.300
my girl met this boy,

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.370
I feel she's taken a liking to him.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.110
As for the boy,

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.570
I watched him grow up.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.560
He's solid in everything else,

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.570
but when it comes to love,

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:52.800
I don't know him at all.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.460
Then has the kid

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.700
passed your test now?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.180
At this house of temptation,

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.690
he only hears music.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.540
Now I'm at ease.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.020
But to me,

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.500
this kid

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.260
may be cold all his life.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.570
Didn't you predict

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.140
I'd die halfway down this path?

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.420
Yet I'm safe now.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.610
I've even had a daughter.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.690
Our family

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.540
is changing in a big way.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:29.660
This kid

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.970
can surely change

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.090
that so-called fate.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.610
In that case,

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:35.300
shouldn't we

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.570
celebrate properly?

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:37.930
Come on.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.330
Here, a toast to you.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:49.330
I've got girls here

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:50.380
who favor

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.450
heroes like you.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.020
You're now a widower anyway,

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.810
your so-called "test"

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:58.930
hardly matters.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.580
[Yi's Residence]

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:10.450
Sir,

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.690
The Three Officials are back.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.330
Let them in.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.330
Impressive, Sir.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.090
You should've been

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.850
the hardest shadow to spot,

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.090
yet you hold the glorious public face

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.780
of the Imperial Father-in-Law.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.660
What nonsense are you babbling?

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.380
Crow, stop.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:33.690
I heard

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.580
your talks with Su Muyu

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.970
fell through.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.140
But at Yellow Springs Pawnshop,

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.570
we ran into Su Changhe.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.210
From our talk,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.900
I got the sense

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.810
that compared to Su Muyu,

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.330
this Patriarch now in power

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.020
is the better

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.090
partner.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.170
You're sure

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.610
you can negotiate with Su Changhe?

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:08.650
Yes.

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.610
He puts profit first,

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.260
which is why

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.470
he became Patriarch

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.170
in the end.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:17.700
And the only person

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.810
who can make him set profit aside

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.090
and act on feeling

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:22.740
just happens

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.330
to have entered Tianqi early.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.780
If we seize Su Muyu first,

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.540
then our terms with Su Changhe

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.220
gain leverage.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.330
By then,

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:37.460
emotionally

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.220
and in profit,

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.090
he will have to work with us.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.610
Then,

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.410
we can throw

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.020
the full might of Blood River

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.850
to kill a prince

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:47.610
in Tianqi City.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.170
Whether Blood River

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.300
survives after that

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.890
no longer matters.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.020
Good.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.330
Then change the plan.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.850
No more waiting for Su Muyu's reply.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.980
Tonight,

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.060
throw him into the Shadow Prison!

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:09.370
As you command.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.090
Sir,

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:21.260
Should we inform

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.020
the First Prince?

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.500
No need.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.940
I've got a bad feeling:

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.780
the First Prince

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.460
has already grown

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.890
dismissive of us.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.170
We must do something

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.130
to show him

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.410
our sect's strength.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.700
Our sect may not be what it was,

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.220
but it still has the strength

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.090
to defend Tianqi City.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.540
Catching Su Muyu

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.940
is the perfect chance.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.410
Good!

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.540
- Good! - Good!

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.090
Here!

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.650
Much obliged, Sir!

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:37.610
Mr. Zhou, after you.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:38.370
Here, take mine!

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:40.780
Oh, you brought no silver?

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.060
No worries. I've got it!

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:44.650
Thank you, Sir!

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:46.780
Buddy,

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:48.090
come with me in a bit.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.370
Know the gambling house?

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.170
The biggest in Tianqi City!

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.090
My family runs it.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.370
I'll help you win some money.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.260
So you're the type

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.740
who calls everyone "buddy"

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.980
after a drink.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.260
I've long heard

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.370
of your name.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.780
They called you some "human fiend".

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.500
Didn't expect you

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.330
to be a dashing young man!

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.740
We just click, don't we?

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.810
How about we...

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.170
Who's there?

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.940
Who dares kill in Tianqi City?

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.740
Who's sneaking around,

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:29.650
shooting from the dark?

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.170
This has nothing to do with you.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.260
Who are you,

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.410
playing at spooks?

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.540
Second Master, please step back.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.170
He's here for me.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:41.940
So he's your enemy?

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.020
Not exactly.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.540
They once belonged to Blood River.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:49.020
Then what ghosts are they?

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.310
They're not "ghosts".

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.540
They're the "deities" in temples.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.500
Only we who bear swords

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.410
are called "ghosts",

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.090
the so-called

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.090
"human fiends".

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:00.780
I don't really get it.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:03.700
Sounds scary, anyway.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.020
Not really.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.300
But Uncle Zhe took my sword.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.020
That's a hassle.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:17.330
Usually,

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.410
I don't use weapons,

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:19.500
just this dagger

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.060
for emergencies.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.890
Good.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.020
I often see Changhe

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.810
use the Inch Sword.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.810
I didn't expect it'd come in handy today.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:33.960
Mr. Su,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.850
another friend of yours

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:35.850
came with you, didn't he?

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:36.650
Yes.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:38.570
Make it a livelier fight,

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:39.850
drag it out,

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:41.090
and stall for Uncle Zhe.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.460
He won't.

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:45.020
Second Master, stand down.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.170
This has nothing to do with you.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:51.370
Zi,

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:52.810
you're generous.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.700
To celebrate me finding my daughter,

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:56.460
you sent four ladies to serve me.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.890
Trying to take this old life of mine?

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.410
Serve Mr. Su well,

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:03.260
got it?

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:04.330
Yes.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:05.700
Then,

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:06.980
I'm off now.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:08.370
Go on.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.020
Mr. Su.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.370
Ladies,

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.650
you may leave too.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.740
I may be visiting the Entertainment Street,

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.330
but I'm not that kind of man.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:30.410
I've got a daughter now.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.540
Then let me

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.170
see you off

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.850
to supreme bliss.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:40.020
I said

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:40.890
I'm not that kind of man.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:48.980
I'm past the age

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.460
of falling for honey traps.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.060
Careful!

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:11.170
That's an Immortal Brush.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:12.130
Every word on the floor

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.940
[Characters]
is a strand of qi.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.220
The qi will be guided by the brush later.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:15.540
He's probing for your weak point!

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.500
Too chatty.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:25.260
Second Master,

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.220
leave at once.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:27.130
Mr. Su,

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.570
I'll repay this life-saving debt.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.980
Watch yourself.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.650
Rise.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:34.700
[Loyal Unto Death]

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:39.700
[Death]

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.380
[Loyal]

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.500
[Death]

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.420
[Sacrifice]

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.460
[Honored in Life, Mourned in Death]

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.170
The Immortal Brush

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.570
writes nothing but death.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.610
Because today is the day you die.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.130
Even immortals can't save you!

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.170
Watch out!

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.540
This is bad.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.610
How can they really go for the kill?

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.460
[Death]

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.860
[Swift Rain]

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.180
[Sword in left hand]

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.460
[Bow stance, right-finger sword]

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:21.700
Watch out!

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:26.130
Su Muyu!

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:27.410
What are you doing?

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.340
[Death]

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.500
[Death]

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.500
You're catching the Immortal Brush barehanded?

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.650
Do you have a death wish?

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.740
Truly the famed heir

00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.890
of No-Sword City,

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.780
you even master the finger-sword.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.500
But this sword art

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.260
hurts both foe and self.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.330
If you let it lapse,

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.610
one finger-blade ruins one finger.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.610
I have nine fingers left.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.610
That's nine arcs of sword energy.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.540
Three arcs to kill one man

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.540
is plenty.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.330
Su Muyu,

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.940
after tasting mortal life,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.650
you really changed.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.410
You even dared visit the Entertainment Street!

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.650
Your father brought me here!

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:56.980
I can vouch.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.740
Mr. Su truly just came to hear music.

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:01.310
So...

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.280
he might actually be innocent?

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.220
Naturally.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.220
Coming here just to hear songs,

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.330
like me going

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.260
to Tianqi's Diaolou Cottage

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:15.650
and ordering a cup of tea.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.260
Know what that's called?

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:18.500
What?

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:21.060
"Having it both ways".

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:23.650
"Acting on the spot".

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.330
Second Master,

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.540
help me look after Miss Bai.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.330
All right.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.300
You still have time to butt in mid-fight?

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.610
Worry about yourself first.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.610
Take this!

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.090
Put it

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.090
on your injured finger.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.460
Thanks!

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.700
Miss Bai?

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.650
Bai Hehuai,

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.220
Medicine King Xin Baicao's senior.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.300
An honor.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:00.700
Honor what?

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.910
I've never even shown up

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:02.970
in the jianghu.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.130
Quit the nonsense!

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.390
So I don't buy

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:05.940
what you just said either!

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:07.150
No, I...

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:09.460
Miss,

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:10.300
you've got me

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.500
at a loss for words.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.500
You don't seem

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.220
too worried about Mr. Su.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.460
Of course.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:25.740
The moment

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.300
Su Muyu has a sword in hand,

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.890
the outcome is set.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.060
Aren't you coming down to help?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.610
Coming.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:55.300
What...

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:56.700
what now?

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.410
It's the Lone Void Array.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.330
Reinforcements.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.130
Who is it?

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:07.130
The Blood River Patriarch,

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.740
the Mu family head,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.480
and...

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:09.930
Well...

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.120
I'll be off now.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:12.130
What's the rush?

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:13.020
Watch till the end.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:18.940
Miss Bai,

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.610
see you later!

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:20.650
Until we meet again!

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:33.090
Su Muyu!

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.410
Master Su,

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.060
never thought you'd be subdued

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.370
by my Drunken Dream Bone,

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.060
did you?

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:43.260
Stop!

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:46.170
Su Changhe,

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.170
why were you blocking me?

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.020
Why not save Su Muyu?

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:50.570
Su Changhe,

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.310
if you want to save Su Muyu,

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:55.130
follow the Shadow Sect's plan.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.580
[Yi's Residence]

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.500
He's poisoned?

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.810
He's been dosed with Drunken Dream Bone.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:14.300
Even if he's an immortal,

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.500
he can't use a shred of martial skill.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.460
His qi is mild and slack,

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.460
as if falling into a drunken dream

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:39.810
that never ends.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.540
Indeed poisoned with what you said.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:47.700
You two did well.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:49.890
Guards,

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.650
throw Su Muyu into the Shadow Prison.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:53.540
Yes.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:06.500
However,

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:09.810
why are there only two of you?

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.570
Where's Earth Official?

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:14.370
He's dead.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:16.500
After all, taking Su Muyu alive

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.740
is no easy task.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:21.300
A pity.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:26.410
Heaven Official,

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:28.700
why so quiet?

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:31.890
A brother died,

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:34.330
and to you, it's only "a pity".

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:36.700
But to me,

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:37.940
it's far more

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.130
than just that word.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:40.940
I have nothing more to say.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.090
Why press me?

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:46.740
I see.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.220
Sorry.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:50.500
I overstepped.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:55.020
By the way, Mr. Yi,

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.260
there's more good news

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.300
to tell you.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.610
What news?

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.460
Su Changhe, Blood River's Patriarch,

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:10.330
by now...

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.260
he has entered Tianqi City.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:16.780
Your Highness,

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.850
there was a clash at the Entertainment Street.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.060
It was between the Shadow Sect's Three Officials

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:21.740
and Su Muyu.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.980
Then Blood River's Patriarch,

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.890
Su Changhe, arrived,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:24.940
but too late.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.850
The Earth Official was slain by Su Muyu.

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:28.980
Su Muyu was hit with Drunken Dream Bone

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:30.260
and taken by the Shadow Sect.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.330
Those Shadow Sect losers

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.060
actually managed a win.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.500
We work with the Shadow Sect

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.850
only to use them

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:47.740
as Blood River's whetstone.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.460
We'll wipe them out after,

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.370
and gain Blood River,

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.260
a sharper blade.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.940
Pity that the Three Officials are strong,

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.810
no weaker than the family heads of the Blood River.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.370
And earlier, their stance

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.570
seemed reluctant to clash

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:05.260
with Blood River head-on.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.370
Why the sudden change?

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.890
How come the Shadow Prison

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.500
is so empty?

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.130
The Shadow Sect

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:24.940
once guarded Tianqi as its shadow.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.890
But when the light blazes brightest,

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.060
and even the night

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:28.980
is lit,

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:31.060
there's no need for shadows.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:33.500
Now the Prince of Langya

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.890
holds the power

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.220
to guard Tianqi and all of Beili.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.060
So the Shadow Sect

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:39.810
has little reason

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:40.610
to keep prisoners.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.500
Some were even taken away

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.610
soon after they arrived

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.020
by the Prince of Langya.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.570
No wonder

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:49.130
Yi Bu is so bent on killing the Prince of Langya.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.260
You can still talk after being poisoned?

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:58.300
This toxin

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:59.460
is no ordinary one.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:01.570
These past hours,

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:03.940
I've tried to rouse my qi

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.170
and break the shackle inside.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.460
But till now,

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.770
I can barely speak.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:14.060
Figures.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.290
This is my proudest creation.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:22.250
Among the Three Officials,

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:24.250
you're the most unusual.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:26.690
Besides Water Official,

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:29.570
what else are you?

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.210
My name is Su Henshui.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.020
I want to live for myself,

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:37.860
not sit like a statue

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.570
in a temple,

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.380
nor be a blade in another's hand.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.130
I see.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:49.130
Who?

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.290
Worthy indeed

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:57.420
of Blood River's Patriarch,

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.060
you sensed my presence.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:59.290
Who are you?

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:00.820
I'm Crow

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:02.170
from Shadow Sect.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.900
I heard you've arrived this city,

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.290
so I came to pay respects.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:09.340
Where is Su Muyu?

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:11.500
He asked me to wait here.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.210
Why isn't he here?

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.210
You want to see Su Muyu?

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:15.940
Of course.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:18.540
He's the Su family head,

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.380
my best friend

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.690
for life.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:21.940
Even if I lose

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.060
the Patriarch's seat,

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:23.820
I won't allow him

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.090
the slightest harm.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.170
If any of you touch him,

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.250
and I'll fight you to the end.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.170
No need to be so tense, Sir.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.900
Su Muyu is currently

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.500
a guest at our sect.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.210
He's fine.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:42.570
Only...

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.210
Only what?

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.250
Such killing intent...

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.170
Speak!

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:51.500
Only what?

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.770
Only that a guest can become

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.290
the host or a prisoner.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:58.570
All depends

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.570
on your sincerity.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.420
My "sincerity"?

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:10.610
Testing my sincerity

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.420
shows none of yours.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.610
And it's dangerous.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.860
Danger is all

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.610
we ever deal in,

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.940
isn't it?

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.210
Well said.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.340
I'm almost impressed.

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:33.570
Speak...

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:36.130
what do you want from us?

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:38.650
We want you

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.340
to take the head of the Prince of Langya.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.460
What?

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.650
Do you even know what you're saying?

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:46.820
Blood River kills anyone,

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.210
doesn't it?

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:51.200
I'll put

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.560
the hardest man to kill

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.540
before you.

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:55.340
No need to

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.020
rush your answer.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.580
Think it over and...

00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.420
And?

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.020
If you turn your head,

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.730
will it

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:05.650
fall off?
