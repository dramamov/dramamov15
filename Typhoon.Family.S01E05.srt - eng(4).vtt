TYPHOON FAMILY

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:54.784
TYPHOON TRADING

00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:12.427
What on earth?

00:01:15.013 --> 00:01:16.055
What?

00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:19.142
Mr. Kang?

00:01:23.396 --> 00:01:25.064
Mr. Kang?

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.941
Mr. Kang.

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:29.068
Mr. Kang!

00:01:29.152 --> 00:01:30.820
-Oh, my gosh!
-My goodness!

00:01:30.904 --> 00:01:32.322
You scared me!

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:35.450
-Are you okay?
-Who are you?

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.368
Hello.

00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:41.706
Mom, I can't turn my neck! I'm paralyzed!

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:44.167
-What?
-My neck!

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.295
-Mom! Help me!
-What do we do?

00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:49.839
You're lying on your side, Mr. Kang.

00:01:49.923 --> 00:01:51.507
You're on your side.

00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:53.885
You're not paralyzed.
He's fine. Calm down.

00:01:53.968 --> 00:01:55.762
He's all right. Please calm down.

00:01:56.387 --> 00:01:57.388
He's fine.

00:02:03.353 --> 00:02:04.354
You scared me.

00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:07.232
Why are you here?

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:09.817
Why are you here instead of at your home?

00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:11.694
-Hello.
-Good morning.

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:13.863
-This is my mom.
-Hello.

00:02:13.947 --> 00:02:15.949
Good morning.

00:02:16.032 --> 00:02:19.327
What are you two doing here?

00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:21.663
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:27.627
Are you all right?

00:02:30.797 --> 00:02:32.090
I'm wearing it backwards.

00:02:36.803 --> 00:02:39.764
I'm telling you, we're okay, Ms. Oh.

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:41.266
We're okay.

00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:44.936
-Do you have someplace to stay?
-No.

00:02:45.812 --> 00:02:46.646
I'll find one.

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.398
-What about money?
-I don't have any.

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:52.110
Wait, I do. Remember the fabric we sold?

00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:54.946
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.907
If you touch that, it's embezzlement.
Don't say that.

00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:00.368
Why? I'm the one who sold it.

00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:03.496
Shall we go, then?

00:03:06.082 --> 00:03:07.000
Right.

00:03:10.712 --> 00:03:13.172
-Ms. Oh, right?
-Yes.

00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:16.801
You're smart, just like my husband said.

00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:22.765
-We won't cause any trouble. Thank you.
-Yes, of course.

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:24.267
Mom.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.561
Stop acting tough and just come along.

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:30.398
-Are you done with that?
-Yes.

00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:31.816
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:38.239
Come along.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.669
Throw it gently, okay? Good.

00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:53.171
We're almost there.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.219
She said that several times.

00:04:00.303 --> 00:04:01.721
-We're almost there.
-Okay.

00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:03.806
-It's right up ahead.
-Are you okay?

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.060
-We're nearly there.
-All right.

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:27.872
Is this the place?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.041
Maybe not.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.380
Right this way.

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:44.514
Watch your step. Please come in.

00:04:47.183 --> 00:04:49.936
I can't believe there are
still houses like this around.

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:51.312
That scared me.

00:04:51.396 --> 00:04:53.898
This is my little brother.
Say hello, Beom.

00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:56.609
Hello, I'm Oh Beom
from Changjeon Elementary School.

00:04:56.692 --> 00:04:59.821
I'm student number 47
in the first grade, Class 11.

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:03.491
-I see.
-Who is it?

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:05.493
This is my younger sister.

00:05:06.577 --> 00:05:08.204
-Just go.
-What's going on?

00:05:09.372 --> 00:05:11.791
-Is he your secret lover?
-How vulgar…

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.338
-No, absolutely not.
-No, we're not like that.

00:05:18.214 --> 00:05:21.134
Do you know how to spin a top?

00:05:21.217 --> 00:05:24.387
-Can you make it jump? Attack?
-Attack what?

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.930
Don't eat that booger.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.351
Is someone here?

00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:40.903
Are you Gap-sik's father?

00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:43.156
My dear!

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.741
My goodness.

00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:48.870
My goodness.

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:51.372
He's not Gap-sik's father.

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:56.085
Who's Gap-sik's father, anyway?

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.045
Oh Gap-sik is our dad.

00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:03.009
You're finally home.
Is the war finally over?

00:06:03.092 --> 00:06:07.138
-The war?
-Do you know how long I've waited for you?

00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.308
-Gap-sik has grown so much.
-Grandma.

00:06:10.391 --> 00:06:15.146
Don't be ridiculous, Grandma.
They don't look anything alike.

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.566
You should go back inside, Grandma.
I'll make you scorched rice.

00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:20.484
-Scorched rice.
-Sounds good.

00:06:20.568 --> 00:06:23.487
I'll make you some. Get some rest.

00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:25.239
-Animal Quiz Show is on.
-Go on in.

00:06:26.574 --> 00:06:29.202
We have an empty room
over there by the door.

00:06:29.285 --> 00:06:31.704
You said you were
going to let me have that room!

00:06:31.787 --> 00:06:34.582
You said you didn't want to pay for coal!

00:06:34.665 --> 00:06:35.917
Please come inside.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.002
-The entrance is a bit--
-I'm late again!

00:06:38.085 --> 00:06:40.671
After all that complaining
about coal prices…

00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:43.674
Then tell them to pay for the coal!

00:06:46.093 --> 00:06:47.136
Is this a good idea?

00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:03.027
I'm confused.

00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:08.574
I thought they didn't close down,
but no one's here.

00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:21.546
I mean…

00:07:22.213 --> 00:07:25.716
Aside from the hat, I don't look so bad.

00:07:43.901 --> 00:07:46.946
Did you only pack clothes?
The closet is about to collapse.

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:51.075
-You said to pack the pricey stuff.
-They don't even fit inside.

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:53.244
You take after me in things like this too.

00:07:55.454 --> 00:07:56.914
They even have a TV here.

00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:01.335
I can't believe
they still have TVs like this.

00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:03.045
Why isn't it working?

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:04.422
-Let me try.
-What do I do?

00:08:04.505 --> 00:08:05.590
Watch out.

00:08:06.966 --> 00:08:08.884
-Be careful with your hand.
-…at 29.5%.

00:08:08.968 --> 00:08:10.303
It's working.

00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:14.181
Pusan Port, the shining beacon
of Korea's export industry.

00:08:14.265 --> 00:08:17.977
Even in the piercing wind, sweat rolls
down the faces of export workers.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.896
At least the blankets here are clean.

00:08:21.814 --> 00:08:25.735
They say sleeping on the floor like this

00:08:26.485 --> 00:08:31.407
is better for your back than using a bed.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.617
You're right.

00:08:33.242 --> 00:08:37.163
-It's been years since I've done this.
-Seriously.

00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:41.000
-It's nice.
-It's really nice.

00:08:42.543 --> 00:08:44.545
-I feel so much better now.
-Me too.

00:08:45.087 --> 00:08:48.132
But it looks like
they don't have any parents.

00:08:52.553 --> 00:08:54.388
-Grandma?
-Yes?

00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:57.183
Why did you call that guy your husband?

00:08:58.434 --> 00:09:00.269
They said my husband was

00:09:01.687 --> 00:09:05.858
taken during the war and died in battle.

00:09:07.693 --> 00:09:11.280
I was 22 years old at the time.

00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:17.745
He was 23 years old,
and my Gap-sik was four years old.

00:09:18.746 --> 00:09:21.248
All three of us were really young.

00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:27.546
My sweet grandson.
You must be happy to meet your dad.

00:09:29.548 --> 00:09:32.468
-So, that guy is my dad.
-Yes.

00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:35.054
Then who's the lady?

00:09:37.306 --> 00:09:41.143
I haven't heard a word from your mom.

00:09:41.227 --> 00:09:44.814
That's why I've been
taking care of this family until now.

00:09:44.897 --> 00:09:46.357
That means

00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:49.443
I have both a mom and a dad now.

00:10:55.426 --> 00:10:57.136
The wind feels cold.

00:11:16.363 --> 00:11:17.698
MOMO'S PUB

00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:19.575
Are you serious right now?

00:11:19.658 --> 00:11:22.286
Why do I have to wear it?
I can just hold it.

00:11:22.369 --> 00:11:25.331
You need to wear it so it can stand out.

00:11:25.998 --> 00:11:28.584
This is what we're paying you for.

00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:30.586
You can get lost if you don't want to.

00:11:31.253 --> 00:11:32.880
But you'll have to compensate us.

00:11:34.715 --> 00:11:35.674
Fine.

00:11:38.636 --> 00:11:40.262
Could've saved me the trouble.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.682
MOMO'S PUB

00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:45.935
You win! Congratulations.

00:11:46.018 --> 00:11:48.312
-Here's your prize.
-I won fifth place?

00:11:49.813 --> 00:11:51.065
Tissues? That's it?

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:56.028
Hold on a minute. Let me try again.

00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:58.614
Sorry, but you only get one chance.

00:11:58.697 --> 00:12:00.866
You can if you order
another bottle of soju.

00:12:01.909 --> 00:12:05.120
One more bottle of soju! You happy now?

00:12:06.455 --> 00:12:07.957
How come he gets to touch?

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.543
-Let me try too.
-You can't touch this.

00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:13.754
-You use this to enter the event.
-Come on.

00:12:13.837 --> 00:12:15.089
-Come on.
-This is…

00:12:15.172 --> 00:12:17.591
-Let me spin it!
-Oh, my goodness. Stop it!

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.594
Stop right there!

00:12:29.895 --> 00:12:32.273
Please sit. Take a seat.

00:12:33.274 --> 00:12:34.400
Are you okay?

00:12:35.276 --> 00:12:36.318
Yes.

00:12:36.402 --> 00:12:38.404
Can I take that roulette for a minute?

00:12:39.822 --> 00:12:40.698
Sure.

00:12:42.866 --> 00:12:43.993
Thank you.

00:12:44.493 --> 00:12:46.996
Okay, let's continue with the event!

00:12:47.079 --> 00:12:48.914
Spin it! Go ahead!

00:12:48.998 --> 00:12:51.792
-Spin it.
-Come on, spin it.

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:54.044
Spin it!

00:12:54.795 --> 00:12:56.463
That's third place!

00:12:56.547 --> 00:13:00.175
You won third place. Here's your prize.

00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:04.680
We have something really amazing left.

00:13:04.763 --> 00:13:06.765
I found it. Here.

00:13:06.849 --> 00:13:09.101
One, two, three.

00:13:10.227 --> 00:13:13.397
You bastards.
How dare you touch a woman like that?

00:13:15.024 --> 00:13:16.442
Come here, you.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.155
If you get caught doing this again,
you're dead meat.

00:13:21.238 --> 00:13:22.740
-Got it?
-Yes.

00:13:22.823 --> 00:13:23.782
I ought to…

00:13:25.826 --> 00:13:26.744
Hey.

00:13:28.203 --> 00:13:29.538
Grab this bastard.

00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:34.752
Do something!

00:13:45.763 --> 00:13:46.847
You bastard!

00:13:47.431 --> 00:13:48.515
You little…

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:52.269
Tae kwon do!

00:14:00.694 --> 00:14:01.528
Is she crying?

00:14:05.658 --> 00:14:07.701
That stings.

00:14:07.785 --> 00:14:10.871
-Please be gentle.
-You crybaby.

00:14:17.336 --> 00:14:20.673
Why did you get involved
when you can't even fight?

00:14:21.465 --> 00:14:23.258
How could I just ignore that?

00:14:23.342 --> 00:14:27.638
Perverts who grope women
need to be taught a lesson.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.391
Guys like that are everywhere.

00:14:30.474 --> 00:14:33.686
I'm not like that.
I can't stand that kind of stuff.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:40.359
I won't even get paid today
because of you.

00:14:41.026 --> 00:14:44.071
I'm sorry about that.
I'll pay you back sometime.

00:14:45.948 --> 00:14:48.534
I grilled this pollack. It's good, right?

00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:50.411
Woman No. 1.

00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:53.038
What?

00:14:53.122 --> 00:14:55.332
I'm Man No. 2, Wang Nam-mo.

00:14:55.416 --> 00:14:56.542
Call me "Wang," as in king.

00:14:58.669 --> 00:15:01.005
-From Studio I Love You--
-How have you been?

00:15:01.088 --> 00:15:03.590
I didn't know you worked here.

00:15:03.674 --> 00:15:04.967
I fry the chicken.

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:06.885
What a small world.

00:15:06.969 --> 00:15:10.764
BANK TRANSFER FORM

00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:22.568
RECIPIENT: SHOE PARK
SENDER: TYPHOON TRADING

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.991
Hello.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.160
Here you go.

00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:36.915
-Did you transfer the money to Shoe Park?
-Yes.

00:15:37.583 --> 00:15:38.500
What's that?

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.711
This is…

00:15:41.378 --> 00:15:43.964
Here, I printed
some safety-related documents.

00:15:44.048 --> 00:15:45.090
SAFETY EQUIPMENT DEMAND

00:15:45.174 --> 00:15:47.509
-I've already received these.
-What?

00:15:48.719 --> 00:15:50.429
That's just basic for a trader.

00:15:53.348 --> 00:15:56.852
If I'd known, we would've
just gone to the market instead.

00:15:56.935 --> 00:15:58.979
-The market?
-Yes.

00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:03.233
There's a specialty shoe store
in Dongdaemun,

00:16:03.317 --> 00:16:06.278
so I thought I'd take a look
for market research.

00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:07.738
That's a good idea.

00:16:08.238 --> 00:16:10.616
I looked into it,

00:16:10.699 --> 00:16:13.702
and safety shoes aren't just worn
on construction sites.

00:16:13.786 --> 00:16:16.580
They're used in manufacturing,
chemical plants,

00:16:16.663 --> 00:16:19.792
and places like disaster sites too.

00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:23.462
That's great. We should go
check it out sometime.

00:16:23.545 --> 00:16:26.465
-It's slippery, so be careful.
-Right back at you.

00:16:33.097 --> 00:16:34.556
-What happened?
-What?

00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:38.852
-Let's go back to--
-Yes, before rush hour begins.

00:16:41.146 --> 00:16:44.108
I had no idea you already printed these.

00:16:53.492 --> 00:16:54.326
Oh, my.

00:16:55.994 --> 00:16:59.498
Hey, Beom. Why aren't you in school?

00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:04.211
-I woke up late.
-What do you mean you woke up late?

00:17:04.294 --> 00:17:07.881
Hurry up and get ready
so you can go to school.

00:17:07.965 --> 00:17:10.008
-What are you doing?
-Hey.

00:17:14.054 --> 00:17:14.888
Dear.

00:17:15.556 --> 00:17:16.682
Me?

00:17:16.765 --> 00:17:20.185
-Where's my son?
-He's not your son.

00:17:22.813 --> 00:17:24.898
I'm hungry. Go cook something.

00:17:24.982 --> 00:17:25.941
Me?

00:17:29.736 --> 00:17:31.822
Excuse me, miss.

00:17:31.905 --> 00:17:34.283
Your brother and grandmother
need something.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.411
Just leave them. They'll figure it out.

00:17:38.745 --> 00:17:40.497
What do you mean?

00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:41.790
How will they do it?

00:17:55.345 --> 00:17:56.305
Whatever.

00:17:57.055 --> 00:17:58.515
I'm not part of their family.

00:18:04.897 --> 00:18:05.939
Come here, doggy.

00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:09.193
How do you want your coffee?

00:18:09.276 --> 00:18:12.237
-Cream and sugar?
-I'll do it.

00:18:12.321 --> 00:18:14.823
-No, I'll do it.
-No.

00:18:14.907 --> 00:18:16.867
No, step back.

00:18:17.618 --> 00:18:19.411
How do you want it?

00:18:20.621 --> 00:18:22.539
Two spoons of sugar and cream, please.

00:18:30.547 --> 00:18:32.341
Wait, what are you doing?

00:18:32.424 --> 00:18:35.219
What are you doing?
The order is coffee, sugar, and cream.

00:18:35.302 --> 00:18:39.223
-It's coffee, cream, and sugar.
-No, we've always done it this way.

00:18:39.806 --> 00:18:40.641
Look.

00:18:41.725 --> 00:18:42.559
Coffee.

00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:47.105
Sugar.

00:18:48.565 --> 00:18:50.442
Add cream like this.

00:18:50.525 --> 00:18:52.152
That's my hand, by the way.

00:18:56.114 --> 00:18:58.659
I was just showing you
how we usually make it.

00:18:59.368 --> 00:19:00.494
Like that?

00:19:02.955 --> 00:19:04.873
-The water's boiling!
-I'll get it!

00:19:10.128 --> 00:19:11.546
You'll burn yourself.

00:19:12.714 --> 00:19:14.132
That thing is really hot.

00:19:15.926 --> 00:19:16.802
It's boiling.

00:19:16.885 --> 00:19:19.096
-You can't touch it with your bare hands.
-Right.

00:19:19.721 --> 00:19:22.266
-Go sit down. I'll bring it.
-Okay, thanks.

00:19:38.573 --> 00:19:43.370
How about we visit construction companies
and project sites around Seoul?

00:19:43.453 --> 00:19:46.081
-I'm sorting the clients.
-Sounds good.

00:19:46.957 --> 00:19:48.333
We'll be on the road a lot.

00:19:49.668 --> 00:19:53.505
You know how important
business etiquette is for traders, right?

00:19:53.588 --> 00:19:54.923
I did a bit of studying.

00:19:55.966 --> 00:19:58.885
I came prepared too, of course.

00:19:58.969 --> 00:20:00.721
Here's how to present a business card.

00:20:00.804 --> 00:20:02.180
Watch carefully.

00:20:05.976 --> 00:20:07.602
The visitor offers it first.

00:20:07.686 --> 00:20:12.399
They hand it with both hands,
so the name is visible.

00:20:12.482 --> 00:20:15.402
Hello, I'm Kang Tae-poong
from Typhoon Trading.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.946
Nice job. Well done.

00:20:19.197 --> 00:20:21.700
But apparently handshakes
are the opposite.

00:20:21.783 --> 00:20:24.786
It's polite for the higher-ranking person
to offer first.

00:20:26.079 --> 00:20:27.706
-Okay, let's try it.
-Okay.

00:20:29.916 --> 00:20:32.169
Hello, I'm Oh Mi-seon
from Typhoon Trading.

00:20:32.794 --> 00:20:34.254
The weather's nice today.

00:20:35.881 --> 00:20:36.798
Who…

00:20:37.382 --> 00:20:38.884
Who talks about the weather?

00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:42.429
Talking about the weather
is an icebreaker.

00:20:42.512 --> 00:20:44.639
That would make things even more awkward.

00:20:44.723 --> 00:20:47.768
Isn't it better to ask something
like if they have eaten?

00:20:48.393 --> 00:20:50.479
-They could ask if the ride was okay.
-Okay, then.

00:20:50.562 --> 00:20:53.732
Try acting like the high-ranking person
and ask about my meal.

00:20:55.192 --> 00:20:56.151
Hey, there.

00:20:56.777 --> 00:20:59.071
I'm Kang Tae-poong from Typhoon Trading.

00:20:59.154 --> 00:21:00.614
Have you eaten?

00:21:01.948 --> 00:21:04.076
Wasn't the road slippery at all?

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:05.827
Which company are you from again?

00:21:05.911 --> 00:21:08.413
-Where is it?
-It's Typhoon Trading.

00:21:08.497 --> 00:21:14.044
EPISODE 5
HEAVEN, WHERE WE ARE

00:21:33.855 --> 00:21:35.399
That almost started a fire.

00:21:46.451 --> 00:21:47.411
I'll also

00:21:48.328 --> 00:21:50.622
take two spoons of sugar and cream.

00:22:03.176 --> 00:22:04.553
She must've been exhausted.

00:22:20.569 --> 00:22:21.862
You're here.

00:22:22.904 --> 00:22:24.156
You should've gone home.

00:22:24.239 --> 00:22:28.118
-I think Ms. Oh is really tired.
-What?

00:22:32.747 --> 00:22:34.374
-What the heck?!
-Oh, my gosh.

00:22:34.457 --> 00:22:37.169
You made the main character wait.

00:22:37.878 --> 00:22:38.879
Mr. Bae?

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.214
You know…

00:22:44.467 --> 00:22:46.761
I wanted to live
an unremarkable life, Tae-soo.

00:22:46.845 --> 00:22:48.013
It's Tae-poong.

00:22:50.056 --> 00:22:51.349
What's that sound?

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:54.769
Did you turn on the computer, Mr. Bae?

00:22:54.853 --> 00:22:57.272
As expected of Romi… I mean, Ms. Oh.

00:22:57.355 --> 00:22:58.857
You follow my every move.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.692
She's a senior staff now.

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:07.032
-Why are you here?
-My feet just led me here.

00:23:07.741 --> 00:23:08.950
CUSTOMS BROKER EXAM

00:23:09.034 --> 00:23:09.951
Customs Broker?

00:23:10.785 --> 00:23:13.872
-You want to study here?
-No, I'll study at a prep school.

00:23:13.955 --> 00:23:17.417
-This place is for rest and recharging.
-Why?

00:23:18.335 --> 00:23:19.920
Mr. Kang said we were family.

00:23:26.468 --> 00:23:28.303
You came to use the computer, right?

00:23:32.015 --> 00:23:34.476
You're asking
too many questions today, Ms. Oh.

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:36.269
That's all for today.

00:23:36.353 --> 00:23:39.189
-You'd better pay for electricity.
-But we're family.

00:23:41.691 --> 00:23:44.361
No, we're not.
And bring your own toilet paper.

00:23:45.487 --> 00:23:47.864
This is abuse!

00:23:47.948 --> 00:23:50.575
Mr. Kang, please say something.
This isn't right.

00:23:50.659 --> 00:23:51.826
What is this?

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:53.787
Why do you have this menu?

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.538
When did you sneak a look?

00:23:56.373 --> 00:23:57.249
No, I…

00:23:57.332 --> 00:23:59.542
I know you're interested in me.

00:23:59.626 --> 00:24:02.837
-But you can't go through someone's bag--
-We worked hard to collect this.

00:24:02.921 --> 00:24:05.924
-You can't just take it for yourself.
-Give it back.

00:24:06.007 --> 00:24:07.384
What else did you take?

00:24:07.467 --> 00:24:10.011
-Let me see your bag.
-Hey!

00:24:10.095 --> 00:24:11.805
-Did you take--
-Mr. Kang!

00:24:11.888 --> 00:24:13.306
-Come on, Ms. Oh.
-Seriously?

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:15.934
-Make your own coffee too.
-Coffee?

00:24:16.017 --> 00:24:19.104
-Fine, I won't drink it.
-We don't have enough for you.

00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:35.245
-Are you leaving already?
-I'm sorry.

00:24:35.328 --> 00:24:38.290
Everything's ready.
You should eat before you go.

00:24:38.373 --> 00:24:41.167
Sorry, I need to catch the train.
You go ahead.

00:24:41.251 --> 00:24:42.252
Tae-poong,

00:24:43.128 --> 00:24:45.505
good luck at work today.

00:24:45.588 --> 00:24:47.173
Don't rush around, okay?

00:24:47.257 --> 00:24:48.383
I won't.

00:24:49.134 --> 00:24:52.637
It's my first day
bringing in the goods I signed for.

00:24:52.721 --> 00:24:55.974
I already showed it to over ten places,
and some of them showed interest.

00:24:57.726 --> 00:25:01.479
I did such a great job raising my son.

00:25:01.563 --> 00:25:02.647
My son.

00:25:03.398 --> 00:25:06.735
After I receive all the items today,
we'll have a delicious dinner.

00:25:06.818 --> 00:25:09.612
We were supposed
to go to Nam-mo's chicken place.

00:25:10.488 --> 00:25:11.489
I almost forgot.

00:25:13.366 --> 00:25:14.451
Then…

00:25:15.827 --> 00:25:18.496
Let's go eat steak
once I sell all the safety shoes.

00:25:19.331 --> 00:25:20.623
That sounds wonderful.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.461
And, Mom…

00:25:27.422 --> 00:25:28.798
I promise I'll get it back.

00:25:31.009 --> 00:25:33.261
I'll get our home back no matter what.

00:25:47.734 --> 00:25:48.818
What's this?

00:25:50.779 --> 00:25:53.740
-It's fried eggs.
-It looks yummy.

00:25:55.116 --> 00:25:57.118
-Can I have it?
-No.

00:25:59.329 --> 00:26:01.956
It's gone cold. I'll make you a new one.

00:26:03.249 --> 00:26:04.501
Come on.

00:26:07.379 --> 00:26:11.007
You can head inside over there,
and feel free to look around.

00:26:12.342 --> 00:26:14.886
Please look this over and sign it.

00:26:16.513 --> 00:26:20.141
DATE OF RECEIPT,
ITEM AND QUANTITY

00:26:22.394 --> 00:26:24.437
-The products are coming from Pusan?
-Yes.

00:26:26.356 --> 00:26:28.191
That's going to take a long time.

00:26:28.274 --> 00:26:29.609
REPRESENTATIVE: OH MI-SEON

00:26:29.692 --> 00:26:31.111
I'm going to wait here.

00:26:32.153 --> 00:26:33.655
-Thank you.
-No problem.

00:26:50.922 --> 00:26:52.340
-Is this the place?
-Yes.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.179
Isn't it great?

00:27:02.517 --> 00:27:03.435
This way.

00:27:10.942 --> 00:27:13.194
What is it?
Why are you just standing there?

00:27:20.285 --> 00:27:22.579
Wait. They were here before.

00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:30.837
Look. This place is completely empty!

00:27:36.009 --> 00:27:37.677
There's no electricity, either.

00:27:44.517 --> 00:27:46.853
All the items were here.

00:27:48.188 --> 00:27:51.274
I knew it smelled fishy.
We've been scammed.

00:27:51.357 --> 00:27:53.234
-I told you so!
-It was here.

00:27:53.318 --> 00:27:55.236
-When did they switch it?
-Hold on.

00:27:56.237 --> 00:27:57.071
Wait a minute.

00:27:59.115 --> 00:28:00.241
Kang Tae-poong!

00:28:04.704 --> 00:28:05.622
Mr. Park!

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.791
Open the door, Mr. Park!

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.394
Kang Tae-poong!

00:28:28.478 --> 00:28:30.855
You'll hurt yourself!

00:28:31.689 --> 00:28:32.649
Gosh.

00:28:42.075 --> 00:28:43.284
Mr. Park!

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.969
-There's no way he's here. He ran away.
-He has to be here.

00:29:01.928 --> 00:29:03.429
He's not here!

00:29:11.479 --> 00:29:12.480
Mr. Park!

00:29:12.981 --> 00:29:14.816
I'm sorry…

00:29:16.067 --> 00:29:17.652
I'm so sorry.

00:29:17.735 --> 00:29:19.696
-What…
-I'm so sorry.

00:29:23.157 --> 00:29:24.158
I'm sorry.

00:29:25.577 --> 00:29:27.120
Please forgive me.

00:29:28.204 --> 00:29:29.539
I'm sorry.

00:29:29.622 --> 00:29:32.166
If you give me just a little more time,

00:29:33.251 --> 00:29:36.212
I swear I'll fix everything.

00:29:36.296 --> 00:29:39.883
-Please forgive me.
-Hey, Mr. Park.

00:29:42.093 --> 00:29:43.970
Did you borrow money from thugs?

00:29:45.013 --> 00:29:47.140
-Oh, my.
-I can already tell.

00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:51.728
They're going to ruin
another small-time company.

00:29:54.022 --> 00:29:58.776
You put Tae-poong's items up
as collateral and sold them all off.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.195
And now you've even lost that too.

00:30:04.073 --> 00:30:07.952
Yes, you could say that.

00:30:09.871 --> 00:30:12.665
Were you scamming me then?

00:30:12.749 --> 00:30:14.208
I wasn't scamming you…

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:18.421
I was just unlucky.

00:30:20.965 --> 00:30:23.593
Do you have any idea
what that money meant?

00:30:24.636 --> 00:30:26.804
I'm so sorry.

00:30:26.888 --> 00:30:28.681
Why me?

00:30:30.058 --> 00:30:31.351
Tell me.

00:30:31.434 --> 00:30:33.645
Why are you doing this to me?!

00:30:33.728 --> 00:30:35.647
Why? Seriously!

00:30:36.272 --> 00:30:40.276
I honestly took your money
to pay off an urgent interest bill,

00:30:41.653 --> 00:30:44.697
but I was going to make it up to you
once things improved.

00:30:45.782 --> 00:30:46.741
And?

00:30:46.824 --> 00:30:49.994
Since when did life go according to plan?

00:30:51.663 --> 00:30:53.581
In the meantime, the interest…

00:30:55.333 --> 00:30:57.377
How did it pile on so fast?

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.586
Forget it.

00:30:59.212 --> 00:31:01.464
Forget about your debts and all that.

00:31:05.259 --> 00:31:06.260
What about my money?

00:31:08.096 --> 00:31:09.222
Where's my money?

00:31:09.305 --> 00:31:11.099
You took my down payment.

00:31:11.766 --> 00:31:14.018
That money
is the only reason I'm still alive.

00:31:21.317 --> 00:31:22.235
Damn it.

00:31:23.653 --> 00:31:27.615
Is there seriously
nothing left at all? Really?

00:31:28.449 --> 00:31:29.283
Damn it!

00:31:29.867 --> 00:31:31.577
There's absolutely nothing left?

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:35.039
Do you have a plan?

00:31:35.915 --> 00:31:39.293
All the factories, shops, and banks

00:31:40.003 --> 00:31:40.837
took everything.

00:31:42.463 --> 00:31:44.048
There's no stock left at all.

00:31:44.841 --> 00:31:45.800
I think

00:31:47.385 --> 00:31:48.928
this will only end if I die.

00:31:50.763 --> 00:31:52.682
How dare you talk about dying?!

00:31:52.765 --> 00:31:55.977
Do you know who has
to pay your debt if you die?

00:31:58.938 --> 00:32:00.064
You can

00:32:01.691 --> 00:32:02.859
hit me too if you want.

00:32:04.861 --> 00:32:07.447
This bastard has completely lost his mind.

00:32:08.614 --> 00:32:10.700
Okay, fine. Come here.

00:32:10.783 --> 00:32:12.660
Come here, you bastard!

00:32:17.707 --> 00:32:18.583
Gosh.

00:32:19.417 --> 00:32:21.753
This is so frustrating.

00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:25.631
Hey! Tae-poong!

00:32:27.884 --> 00:32:31.220
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to report him to the police.

00:32:31.304 --> 00:32:35.349
That's not going to fix anything.
He doesn't even have electricity.

00:32:36.142 --> 00:32:39.353
My goodness.
Hold on. Let me make a few calls.

00:32:41.314 --> 00:32:42.565
Why did you take that?

00:32:43.733 --> 00:32:45.109
Just so I'd have something.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.696
This isn't worth much.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.448
PATENT CERTIFICATE

00:32:50.531 --> 00:32:52.909
You even got the patents.
What are we going to do now?

00:32:55.661 --> 00:32:57.080
You should call Mi-seon.

00:32:57.163 --> 00:32:58.664
Never mind, I'll do it.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.506
-Are you okay?
-Yes, of course.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.466
I'm fine.

00:33:12.053 --> 00:33:13.888
You're doing your best as the boss.

00:33:33.866 --> 00:33:38.162
BUSINESS ENGLISH CONVERSATION HANDBOOK

00:33:38.246 --> 00:33:40.998
TELL THEM THE QUALITY WILL BE DIFFERENT

00:34:08.901 --> 00:34:12.196
CONGRATULATIONS AND BEST WISHES

00:34:13.364 --> 00:34:15.324
Here's your beer, ma'am.

00:34:15.408 --> 00:34:16.284
Oh, my gosh!

00:34:17.034 --> 00:34:20.121
-What happened to your face?
-I got drunk and fell.

00:34:20.204 --> 00:34:23.583
-Be careful.
-Thank you.

00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:25.251
Be careful with that.

00:34:25.334 --> 00:34:28.462
-One spicy sea snail salad, please.
-Coming right up.

00:34:29.172 --> 00:34:31.883
You didn't have to bring anything.

00:34:31.966 --> 00:34:33.009
Thank you.

00:34:34.635 --> 00:34:36.679
You're amazing, Ms. Kim.

00:34:37.597 --> 00:34:41.893
How did you manage
to start a business right away?

00:34:42.768 --> 00:34:46.272
Not at all. I was scared,
so I opened up right next to the bank.

00:34:46.355 --> 00:34:48.149
They're my previous clients.

00:34:48.232 --> 00:34:50.443
-But still…
-Hello, Ms. Kim.

00:34:50.526 --> 00:34:53.404
Welcome, you can sit over there.

00:34:53.487 --> 00:34:57.074
-A bottle of soju, please.
-Coming right up.

00:35:00.286 --> 00:35:02.872
-Here you go.
-Can we get more of this?

00:35:02.955 --> 00:35:04.749
-You can get it yourself.
-Please.

00:35:04.832 --> 00:35:06.167
My goodness.

00:35:06.959 --> 00:35:10.379
-Can I see the menu, please?
-Where's the menu, Nam-mo?

00:35:11.172 --> 00:35:12.673
-It's over there.
-Okay.

00:35:30.733 --> 00:35:31.943
Tae-poong.

00:35:32.485 --> 00:35:35.821
What are you doing here?
You should've called.

00:35:35.905 --> 00:35:37.949
I waited for you.

00:35:38.032 --> 00:35:40.076
I'm sorry. The timing wasn't ideal.

00:35:40.993 --> 00:35:42.995
You must've waited long.

00:35:44.455 --> 00:35:48.376
-What's this? Fried chicken?
-Yes, it's for Beom.

00:35:48.459 --> 00:35:52.171
-We can't be the only ones who eat it.
-Good idea.

00:35:54.382 --> 00:35:55.466
This looks delicious.

00:35:58.427 --> 00:35:59.387
What's wrong?

00:36:01.347 --> 00:36:03.099
-Did something happen?
-No.

00:36:03.724 --> 00:36:07.019
Nothing happened. I'm just kind of tired.

00:36:08.396 --> 00:36:09.272
Okay.

00:36:10.481 --> 00:36:12.275
I'd be tired too, if I were you.

00:36:15.778 --> 00:36:19.949
Your mother didn't even realize
the house was being taken away,

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:23.619
and she's living off her son at her age.

00:36:23.703 --> 00:36:25.871
Don't say that, Mom.

00:36:27.123 --> 00:36:28.249
But, son,

00:36:29.542 --> 00:36:31.168
don't try too hard.

00:36:34.547 --> 00:36:37.550
As long as I have you,
the whole world feels like home to me.

00:36:39.468 --> 00:36:40.553
And…

00:36:42.555 --> 00:36:47.101
I may be a good-for-nothing mom,
but you still have me.

00:36:48.352 --> 00:36:50.646
I won't ever let you go hungry.

00:36:52.523 --> 00:36:55.067
What I regret most in my life is…

00:36:59.864 --> 00:37:01.741
that I never once told…

00:37:04.577 --> 00:37:06.537
your father he could

00:37:07.997 --> 00:37:09.915
-lean on me.
-Come on.

00:37:11.375 --> 00:37:12.293
Mom.

00:37:14.795 --> 00:37:15.796
It's okay.

00:37:17.465 --> 00:37:20.009
I'm fine. I promise.

00:37:23.554 --> 00:37:25.639
-Tae-poong.
-Yes?

00:37:28.434 --> 00:37:29.852
You can lean on me.

00:37:32.563 --> 00:37:35.983
You can lean on me
when things become too tough.

00:37:37.818 --> 00:37:38.694
Okay?

00:37:50.373 --> 00:37:52.166
-Mom.
-Yes?

00:37:54.794 --> 00:37:56.379
I'm having such a hard time.

00:37:58.506 --> 00:37:59.965
It's been so hard.

00:38:02.593 --> 00:38:04.303
My goods are gone.

00:38:05.596 --> 00:38:07.181
They're gone,

00:38:08.682 --> 00:38:10.267
and all my money's gone too.

00:38:13.813 --> 00:38:18.651
I don't even know
where to start or what to do.

00:38:28.702 --> 00:38:29.787
I was…

00:38:33.707 --> 00:38:36.085
I was so scared because of that.

00:38:38.295 --> 00:38:39.505
It's okay.

00:38:41.006 --> 00:38:42.174
It's okay, sweetie.

00:38:57.481 --> 00:38:58.357
That's okay.

00:38:59.984 --> 00:39:01.193
It's okay, sweetie.

00:39:05.197 --> 00:39:07.199
CLEARANCE SALE

00:39:07.283 --> 00:39:09.743
BELLUA

00:39:09.827 --> 00:39:10.828
Hello.

00:39:15.708 --> 00:39:18.544
-How have you been?
-How did you know I was here?

00:39:18.627 --> 00:39:20.754
You told me you worked here that day.

00:39:22.214 --> 00:39:25.050
I've never seen
a woman drink so much beer.

00:39:25.885 --> 00:39:28.179
-What do you want?
-I'm here to repay you.

00:39:28.262 --> 00:39:31.474
-Forget it. Go back to your fried chicken.
-Just a minute.

00:39:31.557 --> 00:39:34.268
Today's my day off,
so I don't have to fry any chicken.

00:39:35.311 --> 00:39:37.396
It's cold today, isn't it?

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.439
Here you go.

00:39:46.447 --> 00:39:47.865
It's cold. Take this.

00:39:50.075 --> 00:39:51.035
I don't want it.

00:39:54.413 --> 00:39:55.915
Woman No. 1, Oh Mi-ho.

00:39:56.916 --> 00:39:59.001
-Seriously?
-It's really cold.

00:39:59.835 --> 00:40:00.794
Isn't it warm?

00:40:02.505 --> 00:40:03.839
Stop following me.

00:40:06.509 --> 00:40:08.969
Sorry, he's not here yet.

00:40:10.137 --> 00:40:12.306
One moment. He just got home.

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.892
Welcome back.

00:40:14.975 --> 00:40:16.310
Good night.

00:40:16.393 --> 00:40:18.395
You got a call from Pusan.

00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:19.438
-Pusan?
-Yes.

00:40:23.192 --> 00:40:25.361
-Hello, Ms. Jung?
-Yes, it's me.

00:40:25.444 --> 00:40:27.279
I found out who took the goods.

00:40:27.363 --> 00:40:28.489
You did?

00:40:28.572 --> 00:40:32.284
-Where is it?
-He's this loan shark I know.

00:40:33.244 --> 00:40:36.747
It's best not to do business
with him if you can help it.

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:40.167
Anyway, I explained your situation

00:40:40.251 --> 00:40:42.086
and told him 500 pairs belonged to you.

00:40:42.169 --> 00:40:44.797
He'll return them
if you bring another five million won.

00:40:45.381 --> 00:40:46.757
So, who exactly

00:40:48.217 --> 00:40:49.051
has them?

00:40:49.635 --> 00:40:53.722
How can they take someone else's stuff
and then ask for money?

00:40:53.806 --> 00:40:54.932
Those goods are mine.

00:40:55.015 --> 00:40:59.103
Listen, half of it
is already useless and done with.

00:40:59.186 --> 00:41:01.438
If you don't want to do it,
you don't have to.

00:41:01.522 --> 00:41:02.356
No, I--

00:41:03.774 --> 00:41:06.610
Hello? This is Mi-seon, Ms. Jung.

00:41:06.694 --> 00:41:09.613
-How much did you say he wants?
-Five million won.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.283
Five million won…

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:16.370
We'll call back once we get the money.

00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:18.330
Okay.

00:41:19.039 --> 00:41:21.542
Thank you. Good night.

00:41:22.876 --> 00:41:26.755
Don't worry about it, Ms. Oh.
We have no money.

00:41:27.298 --> 00:41:28.132
I'll handle it.

00:41:29.341 --> 00:41:30.384
What will you do?

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.554
I'll go get the goods in person.

00:41:33.637 --> 00:41:36.890
You know what loan sharks are, right?

00:41:39.476 --> 00:41:42.021
And they might have priority of claims.

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:54.742
BELLUA DEPARTMENT STORE
CLEARANCE SALE

Have a nice day.

00:42:01.999 --> 00:42:04.752
Level One is imported luxury goods
and cosmetics.

00:42:04.835 --> 00:42:05.669
Going up.

00:42:12.301 --> 00:42:13.302
Going up.

00:42:19.933 --> 00:42:22.686
Level Six is furniture and home goods.

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:23.979
Have a nice day.

00:42:24.063 --> 00:42:27.608
Level Six is furniture and home goods.
Going down.

00:42:28.776 --> 00:42:30.819
Welcome. Please watch your step.

00:42:30.903 --> 00:42:32.446
Welcome.

00:42:33.155 --> 00:42:35.074
-What the heck?
-Going down.

00:42:37.117 --> 00:42:40.496
We ask those who boarded last
to please take the next elevator.

00:42:40.579 --> 00:42:42.414
-Get off.
-Just get off.

00:42:42.498 --> 00:42:44.249
-Get off.
-My apologies, sir.

00:42:44.333 --> 00:42:47.336
Please use the next elevator.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:49.546
Don't tell me what to do.

00:42:50.798 --> 00:42:52.883
You should get off instead!

00:42:53.884 --> 00:42:55.844
You get off!

00:43:01.517 --> 00:43:03.018
That hurts.

00:43:08.691 --> 00:43:09.566
Crap…

00:43:20.369 --> 00:43:21.578
Mi-ho.

00:43:22.204 --> 00:43:23.497
What's wrong?

00:43:27.459 --> 00:43:31.130
Level Six is furniture and home goods.
Going down.

00:43:31.213 --> 00:43:32.673
Welcome.

00:43:33.257 --> 00:43:35.342
You look so cool, Mi-ho.

00:43:40.097 --> 00:43:43.726
The deputy branch manager
got so pissed I didn't have this.

00:43:45.185 --> 00:43:47.104
No one's asking for my name.

00:43:54.611 --> 00:43:56.488
The job's not bad, though.

00:43:58.115 --> 00:44:00.492
-Really?
-I get break time and a nice meal.

00:44:01.285 --> 00:44:02.327
That's a relief.

00:44:07.082 --> 00:44:10.002
And I was told I'm good at my job.

00:44:10.085 --> 00:44:12.379
I'm a candidate for employee of the month.

00:44:13.172 --> 00:44:14.298
-Really?
-Yes.

00:44:14.381 --> 00:44:16.133
Do you want anything, Beom?

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.887
Wipe your mouth.

00:44:23.974 --> 00:44:24.892
Mi-ho.

00:44:25.642 --> 00:44:26.518
Yes?

00:44:29.438 --> 00:44:30.731
I'm really sorry.

00:44:30.814 --> 00:44:31.899
What for?

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:37.821
-Did you take my clothes again?
-No.

00:44:45.621 --> 00:44:49.041
You're so good at your job
even though you're only 21 years old.

00:44:54.463 --> 00:44:55.464
So what?

00:44:58.926 --> 00:45:01.261
-I should get back to work.
-Okay.

00:45:01.345 --> 00:45:03.472
Brush your teeth when you get home.

00:45:03.555 --> 00:45:05.015
-Have a good shift.
-Okay.

00:45:30.916 --> 00:45:32.709
Yes, thank you.

00:45:45.597 --> 00:45:48.350
Hello, I'm Kang Tae-poong
from Typhoon Trading.

00:45:48.433 --> 00:45:49.476
Yes.

00:45:50.561 --> 00:45:53.855
I'm calling you about
the emergency loan for small businesses.

00:45:55.524 --> 00:45:57.901
Two months? Isn't this for emergencies?

00:45:57.985 --> 00:46:00.988
I called because it said emergency loans.

00:46:01.989 --> 00:46:06.076

Hello, I'm calling
about the IMF emergency funds support.

00:46:11.373 --> 00:46:15.627
I actually called you earlier.
You said you'd call back, but you didn't.

00:46:18.839 --> 00:46:19.965
You're saying I can't?

00:46:20.465 --> 00:46:22.050
All right. Thank you.

00:47:10.849 --> 00:47:12.476
-Okay.
-All right!

00:47:22.944 --> 00:47:24.529
Oh, my.

00:47:24.613 --> 00:47:27.574
Who are all these people
that keep messing up?

00:47:28.825 --> 00:47:29.660
Son.

00:47:30.452 --> 00:47:32.204
What do you think failure is?

00:47:37.918 --> 00:47:39.211
Why, that…

00:47:40.921 --> 00:47:43.006
Something like the father of success?

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:45.133
Failure is money.

00:47:45.842 --> 00:47:49.137
Someone needs to lose 100 won
for 100 won to be available.

00:47:50.305 --> 00:47:54.518
That's why failure
is a wonderful thing for people like us.

00:47:58.689 --> 00:48:01.191
These are safety shoes.

00:48:05.153 --> 00:48:06.113
Safety shoes?

00:48:09.658 --> 00:48:13.203
-I need you to go to Pusan.
-Pusan?

00:48:14.871 --> 00:48:16.081
I want you to fill this.

00:48:19.209 --> 00:48:20.043
Huh?

-Why are you still here?
-I had some stuff to organize.

00:49:09.384 --> 00:49:11.219
And I'm going to Pusan tomorrow.

00:49:12.512 --> 00:49:13.472
Mr. Kang.

00:49:16.349 --> 00:49:18.101
Did you get the money?

00:49:18.769 --> 00:49:23.815
I tried asking a few places.
It's not easy, but I'll keep trying.

00:49:39.206 --> 00:49:40.123
What's this?

00:49:47.339 --> 00:49:48.215
What's this money?

00:49:48.799 --> 00:49:51.968
It's the account that you sent me by mail.

00:49:52.052 --> 00:49:55.597
-I added just a little bit more.
-I can't accept this.

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.809
What's wrong with everyone?

00:49:59.518 --> 00:50:01.561
My dad wanted you to have that.

00:50:02.145 --> 00:50:04.815
I know. I appreciate
the thought behind it.

00:50:06.149 --> 00:50:07.150
But…

00:50:08.443 --> 00:50:11.029
This money really doesn't belong to me.

00:50:11.112 --> 00:50:13.406
I was thinking of returning it.

00:50:14.074 --> 00:50:17.828
Still, this doesn't feel right.
I'll figure it out.

00:50:17.911 --> 00:50:20.163
If I can't, we can try something else.

00:50:20.747 --> 00:50:21.998
Absolutely not.

00:50:22.082 --> 00:50:24.501
Go and get our goods back.

00:50:24.584 --> 00:50:27.087
Get them and we can sell them
for a bit more.

00:50:30.048 --> 00:50:31.466
We can do this.

00:51:05.959 --> 00:51:08.461
Stand tall. It's not the end of the world.

00:51:13.842 --> 00:51:14.926
Kang Tae-poong.

00:51:16.052 --> 00:51:20.265
The loan shark who
took your goods is Ryu Hui-gyu.

00:51:21.808 --> 00:51:25.979
Like I said last time,
that bastard isn't easy to deal with.

00:51:26.062 --> 00:51:27.314
He's ruthless.

00:51:27.397 --> 00:51:33.695
So just don't say a word,
give him the money and get the goods.

00:51:34.738 --> 00:51:35.655
That's it.

00:51:37.782 --> 00:51:38.783
Got it?

00:51:43.204 --> 00:51:44.122
Got it.

00:51:44.205 --> 00:51:48.084
I feel bad about what you went through,
so I'll help you up to this point.

00:51:49.336 --> 00:51:50.420
Understood?

00:51:53.298 --> 00:51:55.258
-Yes.
-Let's go.

00:52:08.146 --> 00:52:09.189
It's been a while.

00:52:17.364 --> 00:52:18.657
Not even a hello?

00:52:35.507 --> 00:52:36.549
What are you doing?

00:52:38.802 --> 00:52:39.636
Give me a light.

00:52:50.897 --> 00:52:53.233
You're taking on punks from Seoul now?

00:52:54.901 --> 00:52:56.236
I heard you had grown,

00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:58.738
but you're just the same as ever.

00:53:02.158 --> 00:53:05.036
You shouldn't mess with outsiders.

00:53:06.538 --> 00:53:07.372
Give it to him.

00:53:08.456 --> 00:53:10.834
We'll give it to you,
but only after we get ours.

00:53:11.543 --> 00:53:12.377
The goods?

00:53:14.004 --> 00:53:14.921
Follow me.

00:53:34.899 --> 00:53:36.735
Move it. Hurry it up.

00:53:36.818 --> 00:53:38.028
Yes, sir!

00:53:38.111 --> 00:53:40.363
We'll finish early if you guys hurry up.

00:53:41.823 --> 00:53:44.534
-You left out 500 of them, right?
-Yes, sir.

00:53:45.744 --> 00:53:47.704
-Leave out 500.
-So 500?

00:53:48.747 --> 00:53:50.665
If we leave out 500, it'll be 1,500.

00:53:51.666 --> 00:53:54.169
Let's just round it off to 30 million won.

00:53:59.299 --> 00:54:01.468
Look, it's Typhoon Trading!

00:54:02.385 --> 00:54:05.055
-Did you catch on?
-Wait a minute.

00:54:06.056 --> 00:54:08.224
Hold on. Manager Ha!

00:54:09.434 --> 00:54:10.393
What do you mean?

00:54:10.894 --> 00:54:12.937
Why are you leaving some of the goods?

00:54:18.359 --> 00:54:19.486
Tae-poong.

00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:21.988
This is good, but too spicy.

00:54:22.072 --> 00:54:24.657
Manager Ha, I can't eat it anymore.

00:54:25.575 --> 00:54:26.493
Let's keep moving.

00:54:27.285 --> 00:54:28.369
Hey.

00:54:30.705 --> 00:54:31.831
Are you a gangster now?

00:54:33.374 --> 00:54:37.629
Isn't it better to be poor
than a gangster?

00:54:37.712 --> 00:54:39.089
Have you lost your mind?

00:54:40.215 --> 00:54:43.968
Hey. Do you seriously think we're equals
just because I came here?

00:54:45.178 --> 00:54:47.931
You got any money? Or connections?

00:54:49.057 --> 00:54:51.226
Please stop!

00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:53.269
-Bring it on!
-No, don't.

00:54:53.353 --> 00:54:54.229
Bring it.

00:54:54.312 --> 00:54:55.855
Let's keep moving, guys.

00:54:55.939 --> 00:54:57.232
Let's get a move on.

00:54:57.315 --> 00:54:59.192
-That bum…
-Who are you calling a bum?

00:54:59.275 --> 00:55:01.236
Let's calm down, everyone.

00:55:01.319 --> 00:55:03.613
-You jerk.
-Just leave it.

00:55:03.696 --> 00:55:05.740
-You're nothing but a gangster.
-Bastard.

00:55:06.241 --> 00:55:09.077
-Stop.
-Watch your tongue!

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.830
What the heck is this?

00:55:16.584 --> 00:55:17.961
Get this moving, now!

00:55:46.489 --> 00:55:49.033
Mister.

00:55:51.411 --> 00:55:52.370
Are you okay?

00:56:08.178 --> 00:56:11.097
You can't take a nap here.

00:56:13.558 --> 00:56:15.727
It's freezing in here, mister.

00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:39.417
-Is this fun to you?
-Yes. It's a lot of fun.

00:56:43.254 --> 00:56:44.714
Relax, you bastard.

00:56:46.925 --> 00:56:48.509
I'll kill you if you get in my way.

00:56:59.979 --> 00:57:03.233
SAFETY SHOES PERFORMANCE TESTING METHODS

00:57:24.003 --> 00:57:26.256
What's taking him so long?

00:57:38.518 --> 00:57:39.394
Take this.

00:57:44.107 --> 00:57:46.651
I can't give this money to these people.

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:48.695
It's worth more than that.

00:57:49.946 --> 00:57:51.864
-What are you doing?
-Tae-poong.

00:57:51.948 --> 00:57:54.993
-You can't do this.
-You should go, Ms. Jung.

00:58:00.623 --> 00:58:01.708
Put your feet down.

00:58:02.417 --> 00:58:03.835
I said, put your feet down!

00:58:08.214 --> 00:58:09.090
Let's go.

00:58:11.884 --> 00:58:12.969
Listen to me.

00:58:13.052 --> 00:58:14.804
What good is looking at the ledger?

00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:16.806
You can't even sell an item.

00:58:20.977 --> 00:58:24.480
-How much does that guy owe you?
-Why do you want to know?

00:58:25.648 --> 00:58:26.774
It's 50 million won.

00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:31.738
-It's 70 million won now with interest.
-Make it 100 million.

00:58:34.907 --> 00:58:38.119
I'll sell 7,000 safety shoes
and give you 100 million won.

00:58:39.537 --> 00:58:41.331
Thirty million won for a dump sale?

00:58:44.042 --> 00:58:46.544
If you're clueless,
even a diamond is just a rock.

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:49.714
Is that so?

00:58:51.382 --> 00:58:52.925
It's a great offer,

00:58:54.344 --> 00:58:55.595
but there's already a buyer.

00:58:56.429 --> 00:58:57.805
Who? Me?

00:58:59.807 --> 00:59:01.726
What happens if he can't do it?

00:59:02.602 --> 00:59:03.853
Then I'll take the interest.

00:59:08.483 --> 00:59:10.818
Mr. Park's life is a given, of course.

00:59:12.945 --> 00:59:16.908
DEBT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM
COLLATERAL: TWO EYEBALLS

00:59:22.872 --> 00:59:23.748
So,

00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:27.627
can you put your eyes on the line?

00:59:28.503 --> 00:59:30.421
Don't do this. Don't do this, Tae-poong.

00:59:32.423 --> 00:59:37.136
This is unbelievable.
I'll back off if you're that desperate.

00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:38.221
On one condition.

00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:42.225
You have to let me gouge out
one of that bastard's eyes.

00:59:48.272 --> 00:59:49.232
What's wrong?

00:59:50.942 --> 00:59:51.984
You scared?

00:59:55.113 --> 00:59:56.364
You have to swear

00:59:57.365 --> 01:00:00.076
to leave us alone
once you get 100 million won.

01:00:02.912 --> 01:00:03.830
What's wrong?

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.541
You scared?

01:00:09.752 --> 01:00:11.129
Bring the ink pad.

01:00:19.512 --> 01:00:23.099
DEBT ACKNOWLEDGE FORM

01:00:25.977 --> 01:00:26.978
What's your name?

01:00:33.735 --> 01:00:35.069
That's none of your business.

01:00:40.116 --> 01:00:41.367
I'm just a trader…

01:00:45.079 --> 01:00:46.330
from Typhoon Trading.

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:26.496
HEAVEN, WHERE WE ARE

01:02:00.363 --> 01:02:02.782
TYPHOON FAMILY

01:02:02.865 --> 01:02:04.575
Do we have to try so hard?

01:02:04.659 --> 01:02:08.287
I want to show them
our goods and our good taste.

01:02:08.371 --> 01:02:10.915
She's smiling. Does she like Tae-poong?

01:02:10.998 --> 01:02:13.251
Those sparkly eyes of yours.

01:02:13.334 --> 01:02:15.336
They'll be mine in a month.

01:02:15.419 --> 01:02:16.921
What's he talking about?

01:02:17.004 --> 01:02:18.589
We're not a rescue organization.

01:02:18.673 --> 01:02:20.383
We're a trading company!

01:02:20.466 --> 01:02:22.385
What now?
Why can't you load our shoes?

01:02:22.468 --> 01:02:24.262
Give me all you've got.

01:02:24.345 --> 01:02:26.389
Are you nervous? I'm not nervous at all.

01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:29.684
You're the best trader in our company.

01:02:30.184 --> 01:02:35.189
