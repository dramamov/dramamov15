00:00:01.797 --> 00:00:03.867
(Episode 23)

00:00:06.837 --> 00:00:08.707
You really never change, do you?

00:00:15.477 --> 00:00:16.507
Hey, Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:20.417
You...

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:23.817
Why don't you just move out?

00:00:29.657 --> 00:00:30.757
Are you serious?

00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:35.167
So that's what you really want?

00:00:37.027 --> 00:00:38.067
Is that it?

00:00:41.537 --> 00:00:42.837
Just say it, Dad.

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:47.177
Do you really want me to move out?

00:00:47.537 --> 00:00:50.947
You can't stand me, and I can't stand you.

00:00:51.377 --> 00:00:54.317
So why should we suffer living under the same roof?

00:00:55.317 --> 00:00:57.417
Just looking at you makes me feel so pathetic.

00:00:58.417 --> 00:01:00.857
It's just too hard for me to look at you, you brat.

00:01:01.357 --> 00:01:05.897
You wanted to leave before marrying. Look how you announced your wedding.

00:01:06.097 --> 00:01:09.527
You wanted to leave against our will. Am I wrong?

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:16.037
You're right.

00:01:16.207 --> 00:01:20.707
Exactly. If you were that desperate, why did you even bother coming back?

00:01:20.907 --> 00:01:23.677
If you'll disrespect your father, why aren't you moving out?

00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:27.477
You just stormed out.

00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:29.247
And you just waltzed right back in.

00:01:30.117 --> 00:01:31.417
Because I stormed out.

00:01:33.287 --> 00:01:34.287
What?

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:37.057
I ran away back then,

00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:39.527
so I came back to leave the right way.

00:01:41.297 --> 00:01:42.697
I'll move out when the time is right.

00:01:43.727 --> 00:01:45.037
It won't be long now.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.967
- Don't worry. - But that's my point.

00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:51.807
- Why did you come crawling back? - Because I'm the eldest son.

00:01:55.377 --> 00:01:58.677
- What? - I'm this family's eldest son, Dad!

00:02:00.977 --> 00:02:03.947
I have Grandma and Mom here.

00:02:04.317 --> 00:02:05.587
And I have my siblings to think about.

00:02:06.457 --> 00:02:09.687
Just because we disagree, should I just storm out again?

00:02:09.887 --> 00:02:11.927
Is that the kind of brother, son, and grandson you want me to be?

00:02:13.127 --> 00:02:14.597
If I leave again right now,

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:17.367
what happens to our family?

00:02:20.997 --> 00:02:22.867
So you'll just have to deal with it.

00:02:24.537 --> 00:02:25.637
It won't be for long.

00:02:31.147 --> 00:02:32.347
You little punk.

00:02:33.217 --> 00:02:34.717
All you have is a smart mouth.

00:02:37.947 --> 00:02:39.057
Fine. From now on,

00:02:40.057 --> 00:02:41.987
let's act like strangers in the house.

00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:50.927
That goes for you, too.

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:53.497
Don't start anything with me.

00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:57.267
Let's just pretend we're strangers, all right?

00:03:03.147 --> 00:03:04.147
Fine by me.

00:03:04.677 --> 00:03:06.077
For the sake of peace in the family.

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:28.537
I really did a terrible job raising you.

00:03:28.937 --> 00:03:32.677
I wouldn't say I won the lottery in the father department, either.

00:03:34.807 --> 00:03:35.807
What was that?

00:03:37.347 --> 00:03:38.377
"Dad."

00:03:41.147 --> 00:03:42.887
"Please, just let me go for one year."

00:03:44.187 --> 00:03:45.687
"Then after that one year,"

00:03:46.387 --> 00:03:48.227
"I'll do my military service, and when I'm discharged,"

00:03:49.587 --> 00:03:51.727
"I'll earn my own tuition to keep studying."

00:03:53.827 --> 00:03:54.967
Do you remember?

00:03:56.267 --> 00:03:57.297
Back then,

00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:00.467
when I cried and begged you.

00:04:03.107 --> 00:04:04.507
What did you say to me, Dad?

00:04:06.507 --> 00:04:08.077
"Do you have any idea how much studying abroad costs?"

00:04:08.907 --> 00:04:11.207
"Just give up!"

00:04:11.477 --> 00:04:14.917
Even if we went back to that day, my answer would be the same, brat!

00:04:15.717 --> 00:04:17.717
Money for studying abroad doesn't grow on trees.

00:04:18.047 --> 00:04:20.457
Besides, it was because of my own father...

00:04:20.787 --> 00:04:24.187
that I made you give up your dream. Should I beg for your forgiveness?

00:04:24.957 --> 00:04:26.457
Wait until you have your own kids, you punk.

00:04:31.397 --> 00:04:32.597
That's enough.

00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:36.667
This conversation is going nowhere.

00:04:38.007 --> 00:04:39.507
No. You're wrong.

00:04:42.307 --> 00:04:43.977
Let me make one thing clear.

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.477
I am the head of this household.

00:04:47.547 --> 00:04:48.717
No one told you...

00:04:49.217 --> 00:04:50.917
to act like the man of the house.

00:04:52.757 --> 00:04:55.027
Even after you get your certification,

00:04:56.987 --> 00:04:58.157
what if you can't find a job?

00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:00.857
- I will. - And what if you can't?

00:05:01.127 --> 00:05:02.567
It's a real possibility, you know.

00:05:02.627 --> 00:05:05.597
Even if I must sell on the street or do day labour,

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:08.837
I'll take care of your mom and grandma. I will!

00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:11.977
What if you get sick?

00:05:14.407 --> 00:05:17.447
What if you, Mom, and Grandma...

00:05:19.177 --> 00:05:20.617
get one illness after another...

00:05:22.287 --> 00:05:25.517
and end up needing surgery just like our grandparents?

00:05:27.117 --> 00:05:28.557
Who's to say that won't happen?

00:05:30.427 --> 00:05:31.897
Then it'll all...

00:05:33.257 --> 00:05:34.697
fall on my shoulders.

00:05:35.597 --> 00:05:37.397
Because I'm the eldest son.

00:05:55.247 --> 00:05:57.587
- Thank you, that was great. - Have a good night.

00:05:57.647 --> 00:05:58.657
Thank you.

00:06:00.757 --> 00:06:02.027
I...

00:06:03.857 --> 00:06:06.697
I have never disrespected your life.

00:06:07.597 --> 00:06:12.567
This is your life. Why won't you just accept that?

00:06:12.767 --> 00:06:13.897
You little punk.

00:06:14.297 --> 00:06:18.307
You choosing to go through with that marriage...

00:06:18.407 --> 00:06:20.977
was a rejection of my entire life, you hear me?

00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:23.147
I...

00:06:23.947 --> 00:06:26.147
I haven't done anything wrong to you.

00:06:27.417 --> 00:06:31.787
Stop taking your victim complex out on me. All right?

00:06:32.087 --> 00:06:34.887
You think you've done nothing wrong?

00:06:36.027 --> 00:06:37.627
Oh, you have. You definitely have.

00:06:38.087 --> 00:06:39.597
You've done something wrong.

00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:42.997
Like what?

00:06:43.827 --> 00:06:45.467
What is it, Dad?

00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:50.007
I can't tell you, you punk. If you found out...

00:06:51.407 --> 00:06:54.077
No. It's not the time. Not yet.

00:06:54.407 --> 00:06:58.617
- What on earth is it? - I told you, it's not time yet!

00:07:00.717 --> 00:07:03.247
Gosh, that's ridiculous.

00:07:03.847 --> 00:07:04.847
What?

00:07:05.657 --> 00:07:06.987
Just for today,

00:07:07.687 --> 00:07:10.757
say whatever you need to say, Dad. Just get it all out.

00:07:11.627 --> 00:07:15.297
- Darn it. - Sorry, we're closed for the night.

00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:17.827
Oh, you are? Okay... I get it.

00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:20.037
All right.

00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:23.237
Hey, let's go. Come on. How much is it?

00:07:24.637 --> 00:07:26.777
- I'll get it... - Sir.

00:07:27.607 --> 00:07:29.177
Please use the card here on the table.

00:07:29.247 --> 00:07:31.277
- You little... Let go of me! - Okay.

00:07:31.347 --> 00:07:33.077
- I'm his son. - Let go!

00:07:33.077 --> 00:07:36.147
- So I should pay, right? - Yes, of course.

00:07:36.217 --> 00:07:38.457
Hey, you punk! Sir, this one!

00:07:38.587 --> 00:07:39.657
Use this card!

00:07:39.857 --> 00:07:44.587
I'm sorry. My father is just so incredibly stubborn.

00:07:44.827 --> 00:07:46.957
You call me stubborn? I might be stubborn,

00:07:47.027 --> 00:07:49.967
- but you're impossible, you brat! - Father.

00:07:50.027 --> 00:07:51.027
Sir!

00:07:51.527 --> 00:07:54.367
Sir! Use this card. This one.

00:08:05.447 --> 00:08:08.847
Why isn't he home yet? He's not answering his phone.

00:08:15.987 --> 00:08:18.597
Are you saying I walked all over you?

00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:21.027
No, that's just your victim complex talking.

00:08:21.797 --> 00:08:25.197
If I stepped on you without meaning to,

00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:27.737
then that's just an accident.

00:08:27.897 --> 00:08:31.937
You punk. Accident or not, I was the one hurt.

00:08:32.007 --> 00:08:33.977
So who's responsible for that?

00:08:35.447 --> 00:08:36.847
When I disappeared,

00:08:37.607 --> 00:08:39.277
you were the only one...

00:08:40.447 --> 00:08:43.747
who didn't call or even send a single text.

00:08:44.017 --> 00:08:46.257
Seriously, what kind of father is that?

00:08:46.557 --> 00:08:50.287
Why should I look for a son who doesn't treat me like a father?

00:08:50.587 --> 00:08:52.657
A pathetic coward who ran away.

00:08:54.127 --> 00:08:57.897
Fine, I'll move out! See? I'll just move out.

00:08:57.997 --> 00:08:59.867
If I move out by the year's end. We're good, right?

00:09:01.137 --> 00:09:05.877
You said you wished I would leave. So I guess I'll grant it for you.

00:09:06.237 --> 00:09:08.607
I don't need you either, you punk!

00:09:09.247 --> 00:09:12.817
If you're going to disrespect me, then you're no son of mine.

00:09:13.577 --> 00:09:16.717
Fine. Then let's just act like strangers.

00:09:17.117 --> 00:09:19.257
We already agreed to that. We did.

00:09:23.387 --> 00:09:24.387
Wait a minute.

00:09:24.957 --> 00:09:26.127
But...

00:09:26.657 --> 00:09:29.267
then why do we have our arms around each other?

00:09:30.197 --> 00:09:32.867
Hey! Get off me. Go on.

00:09:34.137 --> 00:09:35.507
I'm exhausted.

00:09:35.767 --> 00:09:39.137
I can't walk. I can't. You go on ahead, Dad.

00:09:39.507 --> 00:09:44.147
This kid. You can't even hold your liquor.

00:09:44.507 --> 00:09:47.617
Come on. Get up. Get over here.

00:09:47.677 --> 00:09:49.287
- Get up, you punk. - My bag.

00:09:49.347 --> 00:09:50.887
- I'll give you a piggyback. - What? A piggyback?

00:09:50.947 --> 00:09:52.557
Just get on my back, you punk. Come on!

00:09:54.387 --> 00:09:55.687
See this, you punk?

00:09:56.157 --> 00:09:58.387
I'm doing this because I'm your father.

00:09:58.657 --> 00:10:02.827
I'm your father, so I'm carrying you. This brat!

00:10:04.127 --> 00:10:06.337
He's never done this before.

00:10:12.407 --> 00:10:14.277
Fine.

00:10:15.037 --> 00:10:17.647
You can't forgive me either, can you, Dad?

00:10:17.877 --> 00:10:20.977
I can't forgive you either.

00:10:21.247 --> 00:10:25.147
That's why I said we should just pretend...

00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:27.017
we're strangers, you punk!

00:10:27.117 --> 00:10:28.357
Gosh, ouch!

00:10:28.787 --> 00:10:32.157
Darn it. Oh, boy.

00:10:35.497 --> 00:10:36.527
Dad.

00:10:38.167 --> 00:10:39.567
What are you doing down there?

00:10:42.837 --> 00:10:46.637
- What a mess. - Who? Who is it?

00:10:46.807 --> 00:10:48.547
Who do you think? It's your son.

00:10:48.807 --> 00:10:52.977
- My son? It's you? - Dad, come on. I'll carry you.

00:10:53.047 --> 00:10:56.387
Carry me? Yes, carry me. A piggyback!

00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:59.017
- Oh, boy. - Dad, until I move out,

00:10:59.657 --> 00:11:02.487
don't expect any kindness from me.

00:11:02.557 --> 00:11:04.187
- And until you get on your knees... - You're so heavy.

00:11:04.257 --> 00:11:08.527
for my forgiveness, don't you dare call me Dad, punk!

00:11:08.597 --> 00:11:09.797
No!

00:11:10.227 --> 00:11:11.227
Darn it!

00:11:12.167 --> 00:11:14.967
You call yourself a man? You've got no strength.

00:11:14.967 --> 00:11:16.867
- Why are you so heavy? - You little punk!

00:11:26.147 --> 00:11:27.317
Good grief.

00:11:28.617 --> 00:11:29.747
What the...

00:11:31.247 --> 00:11:32.257
Darn it.

00:11:33.917 --> 00:11:34.917
My head is killing me.

00:11:35.787 --> 00:11:38.557
Get up and eat your hangover soup.

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:40.997
In a bit, Mother.

00:11:41.397 --> 00:11:43.127
My stomach feels awful right now...

00:11:44.097 --> 00:11:45.227
Eat it now.

00:11:45.837 --> 00:11:47.397
I have plans, so I have to leave soon.

00:11:48.367 --> 00:11:49.537
What plans?

00:11:49.767 --> 00:11:53.707
Goodness. Why keep pestering her about it?

00:11:54.207 --> 00:11:57.007
Isn't today your day to go to class?

00:11:57.277 --> 00:11:58.717
You think it's okay to just skip it?

00:11:59.247 --> 00:12:02.117
What? No, Mother.

00:12:02.717 --> 00:12:04.217
No. Oh, boy.

00:12:04.947 --> 00:12:08.987
Ji Hyuk, eat when I tell you to. I can't always make you soup.

00:12:09.127 --> 00:12:10.657
But I...

00:12:17.567 --> 00:12:20.267
Just give them the soup and get going.

00:12:20.967 --> 00:12:21.967
Okay.

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.207
Here you go.

00:12:35.687 --> 00:12:39.487
Wait, when did I get in last night? How did I even get home?

00:12:39.817 --> 00:12:42.357
Mom, how did I get home last night?

00:12:43.027 --> 00:12:44.587
Did you both black out?

00:12:54.337 --> 00:12:55.707
My stomach hurts.

00:13:03.447 --> 00:13:05.617
I never even got to bring up the business.

00:13:06.847 --> 00:13:08.177
What happened last night?

00:13:09.017 --> 00:13:10.117
From now on,

00:13:11.047 --> 00:13:12.957
let's act like strangers in the house.

00:13:13.617 --> 00:13:14.657
That goes for you, too.

00:13:15.857 --> 00:13:17.227
Don't start anything with me.

00:13:20.357 --> 00:13:21.357
Right, the pact.

00:13:22.567 --> 00:13:24.727
I definitely remember that part clearly.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:28.497
But I can't remember anything after that.

00:13:31.107 --> 00:13:32.877
I wonder if Dad remembers.

00:13:43.447 --> 00:13:45.287
What's the last thing you two remember?

00:13:49.057 --> 00:13:51.527
- Let's be strangers. - Fine by me.

00:13:51.987 --> 00:13:53.297
For the sake of peace in the family.

00:13:57.667 --> 00:13:59.937
Black out? Who blacked out? I remember everything.

00:14:03.007 --> 00:14:04.967
Mom, what time will you be done today?

00:14:05.267 --> 00:14:06.937
There's something I really need to talk to you about today.

00:14:07.577 --> 00:14:09.007
I'll be back before dinner.

00:14:09.547 --> 00:14:10.607
See you later.

00:14:13.347 --> 00:14:14.417
I wonder what he wants to talk about.

00:14:15.217 --> 00:14:17.317
Did Ji Hyuk say anything to you yesterday?

00:14:19.087 --> 00:14:20.787
He said a lot, I guess.

00:14:22.357 --> 00:14:23.857
Is something wrong with Ji Hyuk?

00:14:24.387 --> 00:14:27.827
Whether something is wrong or not, I have no idea,

00:14:28.027 --> 00:14:29.497
and I plan to keep it that way.

00:14:29.897 --> 00:14:33.237
Ji Hyuk and I agreed to pretend we don't know each other.

00:14:34.967 --> 00:14:36.507
That's one way to handle it.

00:14:39.277 --> 00:14:41.477
- Thank you. - Good work today.

00:14:48.417 --> 00:14:52.117
Lee Ji Hyuk comes every morning. So why isn't he here today?

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:11.037
He's getting to me again.

00:15:12.137 --> 00:15:13.237
How ridiculous...

00:15:14.677 --> 00:15:15.977
But then again, Ji Hyuk...

00:15:17.007 --> 00:15:18.047
is being ridiculous too.

00:15:20.077 --> 00:15:21.677
Ji Eun Oh, you're unbelievable.

00:15:55.177 --> 00:15:58.187
I wonder if Director Park saw this.

00:16:07.957 --> 00:16:09.797
Director? What brings you here?

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:15.137
You didn't even get startled? That's no fun.

00:16:15.337 --> 00:16:17.237
This is the first time I've ever pulled a prank like this.

00:16:18.737 --> 00:16:20.937
Did you hear me coming?

00:16:22.137 --> 00:16:25.477
Never mind that. What are you doing here so late?

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:28.177
Oh, Ji Hyuk told me to stop by.

00:16:28.917 --> 00:16:30.547
Why would he do that?

00:16:30.917 --> 00:16:33.587
Because he knew you'd be here working late by yourself.

00:16:34.287 --> 00:16:36.957
Ji Hyuk seems to think I'm your personal bodyguard.

00:16:39.927 --> 00:16:40.957
Such a busybody.

00:16:42.797 --> 00:16:46.697
I was just about to leave.

00:16:48.197 --> 00:16:49.407
Right now?

00:16:50.567 --> 00:16:52.637
Yes. I have my bag on, see?

00:16:53.777 --> 00:16:55.307
Don't worry about taking me home.

00:16:57.607 --> 00:16:59.017
I can't give you a ride anyway.

00:16:59.877 --> 00:17:01.177
I have a family meeting,

00:17:01.577 --> 00:17:03.647
and I just dropped by on my way.

00:17:05.017 --> 00:17:07.417
Okay. You should get going.

00:17:08.587 --> 00:17:09.627
I will.

00:17:11.127 --> 00:17:12.997
Don't stay too late.

00:17:12.997 --> 00:17:15.157
- Eun Oh, you should leave soon too. - I will.

00:17:17.097 --> 00:17:18.127
Bye.

00:17:21.597 --> 00:17:22.767
There's no way he saw it.

00:17:24.007 --> 00:17:25.437
And even if he did, he wouldn't have recognised it.

00:17:25.907 --> 00:17:28.607
How could he tell it was Lee Ji Hyuk in that split second?

00:17:31.607 --> 00:17:32.777
That was a close call.

00:17:47.157 --> 00:17:49.567
Ji Eun Oh is wavering over Ji Hyuk again.

00:17:52.067 --> 00:17:53.937
How could I not have seen that coming?

00:17:56.437 --> 00:17:58.437
(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

00:17:59.577 --> 00:18:02.477
- Yes? - The chairman wants to see you.

00:18:13.887 --> 00:18:15.117
(Shoealls)

00:18:15.117 --> 00:18:16.127
You wanted to see me, sir?

00:18:16.187 --> 00:18:18.187
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

00:18:19.127 --> 00:18:20.797
You started an investment firm?

00:18:22.597 --> 00:18:24.097
Oh, how did you find out?

00:18:24.197 --> 00:18:27.067
Did you think you could use your money to start a firm,

00:18:27.597 --> 00:18:30.137
and that the company or your father wouldn't find out?

00:18:31.767 --> 00:18:32.777
Yes.

00:18:34.777 --> 00:18:37.077
You still have a lot to learn.

00:18:37.507 --> 00:18:38.977
How can you be so clueless about this industry?

00:18:39.947 --> 00:18:42.387
- Why did you do it? - I thought it would be fun.

00:18:44.387 --> 00:18:45.387
And the capital?

00:18:46.117 --> 00:18:49.087
I inherited it when Grandfather died the year before last.

00:18:50.827 --> 00:18:53.597
Did you just need a new hobby? What are you trying to prove?

00:18:55.527 --> 00:18:57.727
You're the heir to this company.

00:18:58.627 --> 00:18:59.997
Why did you act without consulting me?

00:19:00.367 --> 00:19:02.167
Working for our group is my destiny,

00:19:03.137 --> 00:19:05.107
but this investment business could be my calling.

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:07.877
I needed something that I could do on my own.

00:19:09.347 --> 00:19:12.917
Even though Grandfather built you a stable, classic shoe company,

00:19:13.477 --> 00:19:16.287
you got into performance shoes and built that business yourself.

00:19:19.387 --> 00:19:22.627
If I do this right, it could be a new group affiliate.

00:19:23.627 --> 00:19:26.027
Consider it a learning experience. You don't have to worry.

00:19:28.727 --> 00:19:31.097
And here I thought you had no ambition.

00:19:33.867 --> 00:19:36.037
All right. I'll stay out of it.

00:19:40.577 --> 00:19:41.577
Thank you.

00:19:51.247 --> 00:19:53.817
- Welcome. - What?

00:19:54.887 --> 00:19:57.387
Is the usual guy not working today?

00:19:58.327 --> 00:19:59.427
That man?

00:20:00.227 --> 00:20:02.397
He quit yesterday.

00:20:02.927 --> 00:20:04.497
He did? Why? Did something happen?

00:20:04.827 --> 00:20:06.567
Is he sick or something?

00:20:06.637 --> 00:20:09.167
No. My husband and I decided to run it ourselves.

00:20:14.707 --> 00:20:16.407
Hi, Mr. Early. It's me, the Spring.

00:20:16.847 --> 00:20:18.777
I just stopped by the convenience store.

00:20:19.917 --> 00:20:21.717
How could they fire you with no notice?

00:20:22.247 --> 00:20:24.547
Have you looked for another convenience store job?

00:20:25.587 --> 00:20:27.257
I need Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays off,

00:20:27.257 --> 00:20:29.327
so it's hard to find a good fit.

00:20:31.027 --> 00:20:33.557
Let me know when you find another part-time job.

00:20:34.627 --> 00:20:35.627
Okay.

00:20:46.737 --> 00:20:50.547
Fine, I'll move out! See? I'll just move out.

00:20:50.847 --> 00:20:55.577
You said you wished I would leave. So I guess I'll grant it for you.

00:20:59.287 --> 00:21:01.757
Hold on. What's this?

00:21:18.137 --> 00:21:19.637
He must be so upset.

00:21:21.107 --> 00:21:22.507
This is so upsetting.

00:21:23.147 --> 00:21:24.507
Wait, why are you upset?

00:21:27.947 --> 00:21:28.977
Did I startle you?

00:21:37.257 --> 00:21:38.287
Why are you upset?

00:21:40.357 --> 00:21:42.627
You're stopping by to check in, right?

00:21:42.627 --> 00:21:44.097
Go ahead and take a look around.

00:21:45.567 --> 00:21:46.597
Okay.

00:21:46.997 --> 00:21:48.237
By the way...

00:21:48.967 --> 00:21:51.137
The new logo and nameplates won't arrive...

00:21:51.137 --> 00:21:53.407
until the day after we move in.

00:21:53.637 --> 00:21:56.677
I tried to get them to rush it, but the order was placed too late.

00:21:57.647 --> 00:21:59.617
That's on me. I took too long to decide on the logo.

00:22:03.117 --> 00:22:04.187
(Soma Kitchen System)

00:22:05.187 --> 00:22:06.557
Yes, sir.

00:22:08.817 --> 00:22:10.257
At the same time as the showroom opening.

00:22:11.727 --> 00:22:13.857
Yes, I understand.

00:22:19.597 --> 00:22:22.167
Eun Oh. For the Suri-dong kitchen cabinets,

00:22:22.237 --> 00:22:23.937
let's go with the Soma Kitchen system.

00:22:25.207 --> 00:22:26.207
We can't.

00:22:26.707 --> 00:22:29.347
For the Suri-dong project, we already chose AP Group.

00:22:30.577 --> 00:22:31.847
What are you talking about?

00:22:32.207 --> 00:22:34.717
Soma Kitchen is our partner.

00:22:36.917 --> 00:22:39.387
This is the last kitchen renovation the Suri-dong client will ever have,

00:22:39.487 --> 00:22:42.457
so we promised to fully customize it to her lifestyle.

00:22:42.757 --> 00:22:45.057
Soma Kitchen isn't that customizable.

00:22:45.057 --> 00:22:46.457
I know.

00:22:47.827 --> 00:22:50.427
But AP doesn't supply to contractors.

00:22:50.697 --> 00:22:52.197
They only do direct sales.

00:22:53.397 --> 00:22:55.637
It sounds like you're mad at me.

00:22:56.967 --> 00:22:58.237
What? No.

00:22:59.777 --> 00:23:00.907
I'm just frustrated.

00:23:03.447 --> 00:23:05.447
Anyway, finish your inspection,

00:23:05.507 --> 00:23:08.617
and whatever you do, don't come here tomorrow or the day after.

00:23:11.617 --> 00:23:12.617
Got it.

00:23:20.727 --> 00:23:22.927
This is what they mean by timing.

00:23:23.567 --> 00:23:27.137
Just a few months ago, if I'd found out he liked me,

00:23:27.767 --> 00:23:29.767
I would've been on cloud nine.

00:23:34.437 --> 00:23:38.947
Yes, Ms. Jung, but why ask about Yeong Ra's wedding?

00:23:39.107 --> 00:23:41.517
It's a request from Ms. Hwang of Jinhwa Group.

00:23:42.017 --> 00:23:45.517
I heard Vice President Lee Sang Hoon met your daughter.

00:23:45.787 --> 00:23:50.287
Ms. Hwang met her at the reception and was quite taken with her.

00:23:50.427 --> 00:23:52.287
I see.

00:23:52.927 --> 00:23:54.127
And?

00:23:54.227 --> 00:23:58.067
He isn't getting any younger, so they'd like to propose marriage.

00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:02.597
What? A marriage proposal? They've only met once.

00:24:02.767 --> 00:24:07.507
Come on, you know how this works. You won't let her marry for love.

00:24:07.577 --> 00:24:09.647
Of course not.

00:24:10.577 --> 00:24:14.177
Still, we should at least let them meet a few more times on their own.

00:24:16.917 --> 00:24:20.787
Don't get me wrong. We think highly of Jinhwa Group too.

00:24:24.287 --> 00:24:26.097
- Thank you. - Take care.

00:24:35.567 --> 00:24:37.237
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

00:24:38.907 --> 00:24:42.037
- Hello, Director Ko. - Did I catch you at a bad time?

00:24:42.477 --> 00:24:43.647
No. Not at all.

00:24:44.077 --> 00:24:46.717
I wonder if she remembers that night.

00:24:47.377 --> 00:24:49.177
Actually...

00:24:49.517 --> 00:24:50.917
The other day,

00:24:52.417 --> 00:24:55.057
I had a bit too much to drink,

00:24:55.357 --> 00:24:58.387
and I was dead to the world for two days.

00:24:58.957 --> 00:25:00.397
Anyway, I was looking at my phone,

00:25:00.457 --> 00:25:04.027
and saw I'd called you late at night, Eun Oh.

00:25:05.027 --> 00:25:07.297
Right.

00:25:07.397 --> 00:25:10.467
Seeing that made it all come flooding back.

00:25:11.467 --> 00:25:13.007
I'm so embarrassed.

00:25:14.807 --> 00:25:16.807
I feel like I just unloaded on you.

00:25:18.707 --> 00:25:20.177
I'm so sorry about that.

00:25:20.977 --> 00:25:22.347
Not at all, I was...

00:25:24.487 --> 00:25:27.017
I was honestly glad.

00:25:27.987 --> 00:25:29.727
That I could be there to listen.

00:25:30.927 --> 00:25:35.497
You're so understanding, Eun Oh. It must be why I'm so open with you.

00:25:36.397 --> 00:25:38.227
I'll make it up to you soon.

00:25:38.867 --> 00:25:40.597
Thank you. I really mean it.

00:25:40.767 --> 00:25:43.667
Of course. Make sure you take care of yourself.

00:25:45.567 --> 00:25:46.577
I will.

00:25:52.677 --> 00:25:54.347
So she was sick.

00:25:55.717 --> 00:25:57.117
With everything going on, it's no wonder.

00:26:01.317 --> 00:26:02.357
Hello, everyone.

00:26:03.387 --> 00:26:07.627
For these two paintings, I chose a contrasting colour scheme for each.

00:26:09.027 --> 00:26:10.367
Is everything all right?

00:26:11.697 --> 00:26:12.937
You're here.

00:26:13.637 --> 00:26:14.667
One moment.

00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:18.667
I didn't think you were coming today.

00:26:19.437 --> 00:26:21.977
It's my daughter's exhibition. Must I always stick to the plan?

00:26:22.137 --> 00:26:24.377
I came to pick you up today.

00:26:24.907 --> 00:26:26.047
Why?

00:26:27.177 --> 00:26:28.517
What do you mean, why?

00:26:30.147 --> 00:26:34.517
I was wondering if anything's wrong. You don't seem very happy, Mom.

00:26:36.017 --> 00:26:38.527
I was just trying not to look too excited.

00:26:39.457 --> 00:26:41.697
Let's head out. Go get your bag.

00:26:43.067 --> 00:26:44.067
Okay.

00:26:47.197 --> 00:26:50.807
You can clock out, Manager Lee. I'm taking Yeong Ra home myself.

00:26:51.137 --> 00:26:52.837
"Manager Lee?"

00:26:53.107 --> 00:26:56.947
You're her new head of security. It was the chairman's decision.

00:27:00.017 --> 00:27:01.017
Thank you.

00:27:07.817 --> 00:27:09.157
Sit down. I have something to tell you.

00:27:15.927 --> 00:27:19.067
Sweetheart, why do you look so tense?

00:27:19.567 --> 00:27:22.297
Like a kid caught with her hand in the cookie jar.

00:27:22.797 --> 00:27:24.807
Got something to hide?

00:27:26.037 --> 00:27:28.177
Does she know I ordered in for lunch?

00:27:30.907 --> 00:27:35.377
You said you had something to say, so I worried I'd made a mistake.

00:27:35.717 --> 00:27:37.517
No, no, not at all.

00:27:37.887 --> 00:27:40.417
You've been doing so well lately, my dear.

00:27:40.687 --> 00:27:41.687
What?

00:27:42.417 --> 00:27:45.257
Lee Sang Hoon seems to really like you.

00:27:45.557 --> 00:27:46.797
You know, from Jinhwa Group.

00:27:46.857 --> 00:27:49.527
He wants to start seeing you with marriage in mind.

00:27:50.067 --> 00:27:51.227
Already?

00:27:51.367 --> 00:27:54.737
What do you mean, already? Don't you know how our world works?

00:27:56.137 --> 00:27:57.367
Just take things slow and get to know him.

00:27:58.007 --> 00:28:01.037
Consider him your future husband and try to grow fond of him.

00:28:01.337 --> 00:28:03.877
You can grow to love someone if you try.

00:28:05.877 --> 00:28:06.877
Yes, Mom.

00:28:08.677 --> 00:28:10.217
See? I was right, wasn't I?

00:28:10.447 --> 00:28:13.757
About your need for an official title of an artist.

00:28:14.557 --> 00:28:17.027
Beauty without a title is just an empty shell.

00:28:17.457 --> 00:28:19.457
Living in your father's shadow isn't enough.

00:28:19.927 --> 00:28:21.527
You need to have your own accomplishments.

00:28:21.627 --> 00:28:24.967
That's how you reach a higher level in this world.

00:28:34.277 --> 00:28:36.847
You're pretty good. I can tell you've been practising.

00:28:37.007 --> 00:28:39.947
I have to. I got a late start, you know.

00:28:40.047 --> 00:28:42.277
Do you have somewhere else you practice?

00:28:42.377 --> 00:28:43.847
Yes, in the storage shed at home.

00:28:44.887 --> 00:28:46.957
Great job. Okay, next up is Seong Wu.

00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:48.217
- Okay. - Here.

00:28:53.927 --> 00:28:55.957
Mom, what time will you be done today?

00:28:56.227 --> 00:28:57.927
There's something I really need to talk to you about today.

00:29:02.137 --> 00:29:03.207
Hey.

00:29:03.637 --> 00:29:06.607
What's so important that you had to gather us all here?

00:29:06.737 --> 00:29:11.047
I guess Director Ko let me out early to hear his big announcement.

00:29:11.207 --> 00:29:14.247
- I can't wait! - Do you already know what it is?

00:29:15.247 --> 00:29:17.887
But, Ji Hyuk, if this is really important,

00:29:17.947 --> 00:29:19.687
shouldn't your father be here for it too?

00:29:20.057 --> 00:29:21.317
You can just tell him about it.

00:29:22.017 --> 00:29:23.127
He's avoiding this on purpose anyway.

00:29:23.627 --> 00:29:26.127
Fine! I'm dying of curiosity,

00:29:26.327 --> 00:29:27.857
and I'm not waiting for my son.

00:29:28.227 --> 00:29:29.227
What is it?

00:29:30.567 --> 00:29:31.567
It's about my business.

00:29:32.497 --> 00:29:34.097
You've all been wondering about it, right?

00:29:43.507 --> 00:29:44.507
(Daily Gigs)

(Night shift, grocery inventory)

00:29:51.017 --> 00:29:52.017
Hold on.

00:29:52.717 --> 00:29:55.617
If that kid says he's moving out again because of me,

00:29:55.757 --> 00:29:58.557
how could I ever face my mother and my wife?

00:30:00.827 --> 00:30:01.857
But if it's not that,

00:30:02.557 --> 00:30:05.997
what else would he need to talk to his mom about so formally?

00:30:07.767 --> 00:30:08.767
Gosh, but then again...

00:30:10.107 --> 00:30:11.107
He and I...

00:30:11.607 --> 00:30:13.877
agreed we'd pretend not to know each other.

00:30:15.507 --> 00:30:16.507
Oh, boy.

00:30:34.597 --> 00:30:35.697
(My Daughter)

00:30:35.697 --> 00:30:37.727
Dad! Ji Hyuk says his business is doing great.

00:30:38.027 --> 00:30:39.197
This is his company's website.

00:30:39.397 --> 00:30:42.667
What? What's this? A company website?

(Mamdaerozip, Today's Visitors: 2,197)

(My Daughter)

00:30:54.777 --> 00:30:58.017
He's even opening a comprehensive materials showroom.

00:30:58.347 --> 00:30:59.347
And he's already fully funded.

00:31:00.117 --> 00:31:01.387
What? He has investors?

00:31:03.587 --> 00:31:05.287
Wow, I never thought that kid, Ji Hyuk,

00:31:05.987 --> 00:31:07.457
had this side to him.

00:31:08.627 --> 00:31:09.727
My, that kid...

00:31:13.867 --> 00:31:15.337
My goodness.

00:31:16.097 --> 00:31:17.207
This is incredible.

00:31:17.867 --> 00:31:18.867
What is?

00:31:19.407 --> 00:31:20.607
Hush.

00:31:23.747 --> 00:31:24.747
Honey, look.

00:31:24.977 --> 00:31:26.647
Ji Hyuk is running a company...

with a proper website, app, and everything.

00:31:28.817 --> 00:31:30.517
And his office is undergoing a major expansion.

00:31:31.447 --> 00:31:34.687
- Look at this. See? - I don't care.

00:31:35.557 --> 00:31:36.557
Aren't you even curious?

00:31:37.557 --> 00:31:38.557
Not at all.

00:31:50.907 --> 00:31:52.937
What's the special occasion? I see you're cutting up fruit.

00:31:54.037 --> 00:31:55.707
Just come over here and eat.

00:31:56.947 --> 00:32:00.117
It's been a long time since we sat like this at night.

00:32:06.387 --> 00:32:07.387
Gang Oh.

00:32:07.657 --> 00:32:08.657
You're curious, aren't you?

00:32:09.417 --> 00:32:11.057
About how I was adopted.

00:32:12.987 --> 00:32:14.657
Why bring that up now?

00:32:16.427 --> 00:32:18.697
Because Gang Oh seems curious but can't bring himself to ask.

00:32:19.937 --> 00:32:21.437
We're family. He deserves to know.

00:32:22.667 --> 00:32:24.167
You don't have to bottle up your questions.

00:32:26.367 --> 00:32:28.877
Did you know from the very beginning?

00:32:30.007 --> 00:32:34.617
No, I found out in ninth grade when I had my blood type tested.

00:32:35.877 --> 00:32:36.887
What was that like?

00:32:37.447 --> 00:32:38.617
I was shocked.

00:32:39.547 --> 00:32:41.587
I asked her about it that very day.

00:32:41.857 --> 00:32:43.227
I asked Mom if she found me somewhere.

00:32:45.387 --> 00:32:46.387
What happened?

00:32:47.557 --> 00:32:49.057
I told her I did.

00:32:50.097 --> 00:32:51.097
Seriously?

00:32:52.027 --> 00:32:53.167
You must've gone off the rails.

00:32:54.797 --> 00:32:55.797
I didn't, though.

00:32:56.807 --> 00:32:58.307
For one, it just didn't feel real.

00:32:59.537 --> 00:33:01.077
Mom and Dad were so much like my own parents,

00:33:02.137 --> 00:33:03.307
and you were my little brother.

00:33:05.077 --> 00:33:07.747
If anything, I just wondered...

00:33:07.817 --> 00:33:10.317
what I would have done if they hadn't been my parents.

00:33:11.487 --> 00:33:14.857
On TV, learning your birth secret always makes you go off the rails.

00:33:15.187 --> 00:33:17.287
In this family, you were the one who did that, Gang Oh.

00:33:17.657 --> 00:33:18.687
That's true.

00:33:19.387 --> 00:33:20.397
You know, that's pretty funny.

00:33:21.057 --> 00:33:23.867
You found out you were adopted, said, "Okay," and that was that.

00:33:23.967 --> 00:33:24.997
But I was the one who threw a fit.

00:33:29.167 --> 00:33:31.137
After Mom and Dad got married,

00:33:31.867 --> 00:33:33.907
they couldn't have a baby for a long time.

00:33:35.337 --> 00:33:36.747
So they decided to adopt...

00:33:37.507 --> 00:33:40.217
and went to an orphanage in Cheongju someone told them about,

00:33:40.817 --> 00:33:41.817
and that's where they found me.

00:33:43.287 --> 00:33:45.617
It was late autumn, so it was a bit chilly,

00:33:46.817 --> 00:33:48.157
and in a corner of the yard,

00:33:51.057 --> 00:33:52.727
there was your sister, under the shade of a tree,

00:33:53.857 --> 00:33:55.597
crouched down all by herself.

00:33:57.027 --> 00:33:59.727
While all the other kids were out playing in the sun.

00:34:04.307 --> 00:34:05.307
She said I looked...

00:34:06.407 --> 00:34:10.507
exactly like a child waiting for her parents.

00:34:11.377 --> 00:34:12.377
That's right.

00:34:14.047 --> 00:34:16.347
You looked just like our long-lost daughter.

00:34:17.747 --> 00:34:19.987
I thought, "My goodness. What's she doing over there?"

00:34:20.687 --> 00:34:22.017
"She should be at home with us."

00:34:23.217 --> 00:34:25.587
- It sounds like fate. - It was.

00:34:27.057 --> 00:34:29.727
How did you end up at that orphanage anyway?

00:34:31.727 --> 00:34:32.727
I was told someone abandoned me.

00:34:33.497 --> 00:34:36.937
Someone was having a hard time raising her,

00:34:37.567 --> 00:34:39.837
so they just left her there. That's all we heard.

00:34:41.677 --> 00:34:42.707
You really were abandoned.

00:34:48.917 --> 00:34:50.417
Missing someone so much it drives you crazy...

00:34:52.947 --> 00:34:53.957
Do you have any idea what that's like?

00:34:56.957 --> 00:34:57.957
Eun Oh.

00:34:58.827 --> 00:35:01.027
What are you thinking about? What? You're spacing out.

00:35:02.027 --> 00:35:04.267
What? Oh, sorry.

00:35:04.467 --> 00:35:06.067
I was just thinking of someone.

00:35:10.067 --> 00:35:11.067
Here.

00:35:12.567 --> 00:35:14.207
All right, let's eat.

00:35:22.147 --> 00:35:24.717
I had to leave one of my twins with my neighbour...

00:35:25.887 --> 00:35:28.257
and carried the other on my back while I sold insurance door-to-door.

00:35:30.627 --> 00:35:34.697
A fire broke out at the Busan Market where she'd taken my daughter.

(On October 5, 1997, a major fire broke out at Nammun Market...)

00:35:52.747 --> 00:35:53.747
My gosh.

00:35:56.887 --> 00:35:57.887
Even after all that,

00:35:58.847 --> 00:36:01.987
she held out hope that her daughter was alive.

00:36:03.887 --> 00:36:06.427
Losing my daughter tore my heart to pieces,

00:36:08.497 --> 00:36:11.597
and now my son's suffering is ripping me apart.

00:36:16.537 --> 00:36:18.637
What's wrong with her son?

00:36:22.737 --> 00:36:23.947
This is so heartbreaking.

00:36:27.277 --> 00:36:29.247
Why does my heart ache so much over this?

00:36:45.227 --> 00:36:47.437
Oh, Dad, you go first.

00:36:52.907 --> 00:36:54.407
I told him to go first.

00:36:57.407 --> 00:36:59.547
Looks like Dad remembers everything from yesterday.

00:37:04.417 --> 00:37:05.417
Did you sleep well?

00:37:05.687 --> 00:37:07.817
Mom. How's Dad taking it?

00:37:07.917 --> 00:37:08.987
Ji Hyuk's business, I mean.

00:37:09.887 --> 00:37:11.057
Your dad doesn't know.

00:37:11.427 --> 00:37:13.757
What do you mean he doesn't know? As soon as I heard about it,

00:37:13.757 --> 00:37:16.057
I sent him the links to the website and the app.

00:37:16.797 --> 00:37:17.797
You did?

00:37:18.397 --> 00:37:19.597
Didn't Dad say anything?

00:37:21.267 --> 00:37:23.707
Oh, boy. He's proud of his son,

00:37:23.867 --> 00:37:25.667
but he can't let go of all that pent-up anger.

00:37:26.637 --> 00:37:28.377
He must be miserable, Mr. Lee Sang Cheol.

00:37:34.317 --> 00:37:35.317
Su Bin?

00:37:36.717 --> 00:37:37.717
Yes, Manager?

00:37:40.757 --> 00:37:43.857
This is your replacement from HQ. Say hello to each other.

00:37:43.927 --> 00:37:44.927
I'm Kim Min Ji.

00:37:45.287 --> 00:37:47.097
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Su Bin.

00:37:47.857 --> 00:37:51.827
Min Ji is new to retail. Su Bin, please show her the ropes.

00:37:51.897 --> 00:37:52.897
Okay.

00:37:56.067 --> 00:37:58.537
When you get in, you dust off the shoes first,

00:37:58.607 --> 00:38:02.137
straighten the displays, then check the stockroom inventory.

00:38:02.537 --> 00:38:05.047
Know our stock by size and colour daily...

00:38:05.047 --> 00:38:07.347
so you can help customers quickly.

00:38:08.517 --> 00:38:12.047
And one more thing. Never let an item go out of stock.

00:38:12.317 --> 00:38:14.187
Always check to make sure customers can try on...

00:38:14.187 --> 00:38:15.217
any shoe they ask for.

00:38:15.387 --> 00:38:16.387
My gosh.

00:38:16.687 --> 00:38:19.127
How am I supposed to memorize all that?

00:38:19.487 --> 00:38:21.657
I'll organise everything into a file for you.

00:38:22.057 --> 00:38:25.097
Go change into your uniform. We'll pick this up after.

00:38:27.437 --> 00:38:28.437
Okay.

00:38:34.177 --> 00:38:35.177
(Shoealls)

00:38:35.277 --> 00:38:36.277
Director.

00:38:36.777 --> 00:38:38.777
The intern from HQ started today.

00:38:39.407 --> 00:38:40.417
Oh, she did?

00:38:41.417 --> 00:38:44.417
Thank you for being so accommodating.

00:38:45.017 --> 00:38:46.587
No, I should be thanking you.

00:38:47.187 --> 00:38:51.227
Thanks to Su Bin, it's been livelier and our sales have gone up.

00:38:52.587 --> 00:38:53.597
I'm glad to hear that.

00:38:56.457 --> 00:38:57.467
All right.

00:39:03.067 --> 00:39:04.737
Looks like she really worked hard.

00:39:08.707 --> 00:39:10.607
Thank you. Have a good one.

00:39:11.407 --> 00:39:13.647
Do you have this in a size bigger?

00:39:15.547 --> 00:39:17.047
But you already tried that one on.

00:39:17.387 --> 00:39:18.387
Oh, did I?

00:39:18.687 --> 00:39:21.157
That one was too big, and this one is a bit tight.

00:39:23.557 --> 00:39:24.557
I see.

00:39:26.627 --> 00:39:27.627
Oh, well. I guess not, then.

00:39:28.757 --> 00:39:29.757
Ma'am!

00:39:31.067 --> 00:39:34.537
The laces look a little tight. May I take a look for you?

00:39:34.767 --> 00:39:35.767
Oh, sure.

00:39:45.777 --> 00:39:47.017
Why don't you try walking in them now?

00:39:48.817 --> 00:39:50.417
Oh, my. They fit perfectly now.

00:39:50.987 --> 00:39:53.087
- They're so comfortable. - So this pair works for you?

00:39:53.147 --> 00:39:54.887
- Oh, yes. - Should I ring these up for you?

00:39:55.287 --> 00:39:56.317
Thank you.

00:39:56.757 --> 00:39:57.757
Thank you.

00:39:58.787 --> 00:40:01.427
(Shoealls)

00:40:04.397 --> 00:40:05.397
Min Ji.

00:40:05.997 --> 00:40:08.367
You must make the customer stand up and walk around in the shoes.

00:40:08.767 --> 00:40:12.307
A fitting shoe can be uncomfortable if they're just sitting down.

00:40:13.537 --> 00:40:17.807
But isn't it up to the customer to walk around in them?

00:40:18.507 --> 00:40:19.507
Min Ji.

00:40:20.107 --> 00:40:23.017
Let's grab lunch. I can give you some sales pointers.

00:40:25.347 --> 00:40:26.587
You were just a part-timer, weren't you?

00:40:30.757 --> 00:40:33.457
- But I still have to train you... - I'd rather eat alone.

00:40:35.257 --> 00:40:36.497
I think I'd get indigestion.

00:40:46.537 --> 00:40:49.977
Oh, we have to take turns for lunch. This is a problem.

00:40:50.877 --> 00:40:52.107
She has zero motivation.

00:40:56.177 --> 00:40:57.187
Manager.

00:40:58.187 --> 00:40:59.687
How's the training going?

00:41:00.587 --> 00:41:04.257
- Tomorrow's your last day, right? - Well...

00:41:04.587 --> 00:41:05.587
Manager.

00:41:06.257 --> 00:41:09.157
I'll keep working until Min Ji gets the hang of it.

00:41:09.827 --> 00:41:12.027
I want to make sure she's fully trained before I leave.

00:41:12.297 --> 00:41:14.167
I would be so grateful if you could do that.

00:41:15.567 --> 00:41:17.467
But starting today, you can leave at 4pm.

00:41:18.067 --> 00:41:20.237
That way, I won't feel as bad about borrowing you from Director Park.

00:41:20.607 --> 00:41:21.607
Understood.

00:41:24.147 --> 00:41:25.147
At 4pm? That's great.

00:41:25.507 --> 00:41:27.477
I needed to prep for the next concept anyway.

00:41:28.377 --> 00:41:31.147
- Hey. - Today's the day? What do we do?

00:41:31.217 --> 00:41:32.647
We have to hide before the darkness falls.

00:41:33.447 --> 00:41:34.457
(Smirks)

00:41:35.417 --> 00:41:37.887
What? Dokgo Chan's heart is glowing too.

00:41:37.887 --> 00:41:40.287
So true love gives you a heart?

00:41:41.297 --> 00:41:43.657
No way! Jin Woo figured it out.

00:41:43.657 --> 00:41:45.527
That Dokgo Chan has fallen in love with So Ri.

00:41:46.397 --> 00:41:49.897
But Jin Woo didn't see Dokgo Chan during the last blackout, right?

00:41:50.197 --> 00:41:51.267
No, that's not it.

00:41:51.907 --> 00:41:55.377
Remember? I said the heart of love wasn't just about romantic love.

00:41:55.837 --> 00:41:58.607
Chan loves his little sister, La Ni. For real.

00:41:58.877 --> 00:42:02.277
But it's only people in true love whose hearts glow...

00:42:02.417 --> 00:42:05.517
and don't get bitten by zombies, and Chan and So Ri don't know that.

00:42:06.187 --> 00:42:07.557
There are only rumours flying around.

00:42:08.457 --> 00:42:09.487
But this is huge.

00:42:10.087 --> 00:42:12.627
But Jin Woo must take her to the lab.

00:42:12.627 --> 00:42:13.757
To take out her heart.

00:42:14.197 --> 00:42:16.627
So he'll try to trick So Ri any way he can.

00:42:17.197 --> 00:42:19.167
How?

00:42:19.467 --> 00:42:20.897
That's what we're going to figure out now.

00:42:22.067 --> 00:42:25.237
Park Yeong Ra, you've been writing pretty fast lately.

00:42:25.637 --> 00:42:29.477
Is it because your only reader is dying to know what happens next?

00:42:31.147 --> 00:42:34.447
I might see Mr. Lee Sang Hoon more after his business trip.

00:42:35.117 --> 00:42:36.147
Seeing him more often?

00:42:36.817 --> 00:42:38.687
I guess your last date went pretty well.

00:42:39.447 --> 00:42:40.687
Not "pretty well," exactly.

00:42:41.617 --> 00:42:42.787
It just wasn't bad.

00:42:43.927 --> 00:42:45.427
You're going to see him often just because it wasn't bad?

00:42:46.027 --> 00:42:48.697
Next, you'll be saying you're getting married next month.

00:42:48.997 --> 00:42:50.427
Not next month.

00:42:50.827 --> 00:42:52.097
But I might get married this year.

00:42:53.867 --> 00:42:54.937
What?

00:42:55.437 --> 00:42:58.967
It seems his family wants to proceed with the marriage.

00:42:59.767 --> 00:43:00.777
"It seems?"

00:43:02.077 --> 00:43:05.747
- Mom said to date him for marriage. - She did?

00:43:06.277 --> 00:43:07.547
Your mom told you to do that again?

00:43:08.447 --> 00:43:11.887
You're seriously going to date him because your mom told you to?

00:43:13.387 --> 00:43:14.387
Park Yeong Ra!

00:43:14.657 --> 00:43:18.727
We're talking about marriage here! We're talking about your whole life.

00:43:18.827 --> 00:43:20.757
What, you're just going to marry him because he comes from a good family?

00:43:21.227 --> 00:43:24.997
How can you talk of marrying a guy you've only met once?

00:43:25.367 --> 00:43:27.867
Do you even know what food he likes? Have you held his hand?

00:43:27.997 --> 00:43:28.997
Have you kissed him?

00:43:29.697 --> 00:43:31.967
A kiss? Come on!

00:43:33.037 --> 00:43:34.477
Forget it. Never mind.

00:43:34.807 --> 00:43:37.207
I can't believe you're still doing whatever your mom says.

00:43:38.077 --> 00:43:40.307
Gosh, I'm wasting my breath. Do whatever you want!

00:43:50.857 --> 00:43:54.597
Forget it. It's your life. Go ahead and ruin it.

00:43:54.757 --> 00:43:56.297
I couldn't care less!

00:43:57.997 --> 00:44:00.327
Still, this isn't right.

00:44:01.597 --> 00:44:02.637
Why am I getting so angry?

00:44:04.037 --> 00:44:07.507
Why would someone so talented not live her own life?

00:44:07.537 --> 00:44:10.307
Her webtoon is so ridiculously good.

00:44:11.507 --> 00:44:13.377
Gosh, why doesn't she see her own talent?

00:44:16.477 --> 00:44:17.587
How do I make her see it?

00:44:18.717 --> 00:44:20.317
- Grandma! - That feels nice.

00:44:20.317 --> 00:44:21.517
Is that you, Su Bin?

00:44:22.257 --> 00:44:24.557
Grandma. Why are you wearing this?

00:44:25.857 --> 00:44:26.857
Why?

00:44:27.127 --> 00:44:30.397
It's mine. The one I bought and left in your room.

00:44:30.827 --> 00:44:31.827
What was that?

00:44:34.537 --> 00:44:36.937
Oh, dear! You're right.

00:44:37.467 --> 00:44:41.007
Goodness, I must have mixed them up. I had no idea.

00:44:41.737 --> 00:44:45.647
But why would you buy clothes fit for a grandma?

00:44:47.177 --> 00:44:48.717
It really does look like a grandma's outfit.

00:44:49.077 --> 00:44:50.447
This is hilarious, Grandma.

00:44:52.047 --> 00:44:53.687
Oh, Grandma!

00:44:55.157 --> 00:44:56.157
Hold on a second.

00:44:57.087 --> 00:44:59.187
This is my first time going live,

00:44:59.187 --> 00:45:00.957
but the funniest thing just happened.

00:45:01.097 --> 00:45:03.457
And I'm not sure who's watching, but I just had to quickly jump on.

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:05.997
You guys know I changed my concept to vintage, right?

00:45:06.367 --> 00:45:08.997
I went to Dongmyo and bought tons of vintage clothes.

00:45:08.997 --> 00:45:11.337
When I got home, my grandma told me...

00:45:11.337 --> 00:45:14.477
she thought the clothes were hers and had gone out wearing them.

00:45:14.877 --> 00:45:15.877
Check this out.

00:45:16.337 --> 00:45:17.677
These are my grandma's clothes.

00:45:18.077 --> 00:45:19.977
- Grandma. - Oh, dear.

00:45:20.307 --> 00:45:23.047
And my grandma's wearing the clothes I bought.

00:45:23.677 --> 00:45:24.787
They look so similar, right?

00:45:24.847 --> 00:45:26.647
(They say fashion is cyclical, and it's so true.)

00:45:26.817 --> 00:45:27.817
Look at this. Look.

00:45:28.117 --> 00:45:29.387
- What? - What is all this?

00:45:29.457 --> 00:45:31.057
Grandma, no! Don't get too close!

00:45:31.727 --> 00:45:33.187
(Grandma's smile is crazy cute.)

00:45:33.327 --> 00:45:34.657
(She's so adorable!)

00:45:34.797 --> 00:45:38.127
Grandma, they say you're pretty! They're calling you cute!

00:45:38.427 --> 00:45:39.627
- Me? - Yes.

00:45:39.697 --> 00:45:40.697
When did they see me?

00:45:40.867 --> 00:45:43.867
Right now! Grandma, you know how some TV shows are broadcast live?

00:45:44.067 --> 00:45:45.607
- Yes. - This is a live stream.

00:45:47.537 --> 00:45:49.037
My gosh, there are 40...

00:45:49.777 --> 00:45:52.747
Gosh, 80 people are watching now. That's amazing!

00:45:53.047 --> 00:45:54.047
- Oh, my. - My gosh, really?

00:45:54.577 --> 00:45:56.777
Oh, dear. Hello, everyone.

00:45:56.777 --> 00:46:01.587
- I'm Su Bin's grandmother. - Grandma, it's Bini.

00:46:01.787 --> 00:46:05.057
Oh, right. I'm Bini's grandma.

00:46:05.127 --> 00:46:08.697
- Hello. - Hello.

00:46:08.797 --> 00:46:10.867
(Your grandma made me laugh. You two seem so close.)

00:46:11.367 --> 00:46:13.497
Grandma, they're saying we should try swapping our shirts.

- Grandma! - Goodness, where are you changing?

00:46:23.307 --> 00:46:25.977
- Come on, Grandma, wear mine. - It won't fit.

00:46:26.047 --> 00:46:28.877
- Here, I'll help you. - I don't know. I give up.

It's her grandma's shirt, but why does it look so cute on her?

00:46:41.827 --> 00:46:44.027
How do they both look good after swapping?

00:46:44.527 --> 00:46:46.267
Your grandma has a great fashion sense.

00:46:46.267 --> 00:46:47.397
She looks like a model.

Bini, keep wearing your grandma's clothes!

What are they all saying? Are they saying I look ridiculous?

00:46:53.907 --> 00:46:57.677
No, they're saying you look so cool. Like a model.

00:46:57.847 --> 00:46:58.847

00:47:07.757 --> 00:47:10.517
Wow, who knew Ji Hyuk had a knack for business?

00:47:10.857 --> 00:47:12.427
Look at his daily visitor count.

00:47:12.887 --> 00:47:14.727
Yes, with numbers like these, he's totally established!

00:47:15.057 --> 00:47:19.667
I know. And on top of all that, he's opening a design showroom.

00:47:19.767 --> 00:47:21.967
- He even got investor funding. - Really?

00:47:22.997 --> 00:47:25.267
He's moving at the speed of a bullet train.

00:47:25.967 --> 00:47:28.337
But that's what worries me even more.

00:47:28.437 --> 00:47:33.007
Goodness. But you're in no position to give him advice, right?

00:47:33.577 --> 00:47:36.377
Would he listen if I said something? He'd just think I'm nagging him.

00:47:37.047 --> 00:47:39.247
No, he wouldn't even take me seriously.

00:47:39.717 --> 00:47:40.987
Hey, come on. Don't be like that.

00:47:42.517 --> 00:47:44.827
He must think I'm such a joke.

00:47:45.327 --> 00:47:47.597
I told him he was acting high and mighty, offering to pay...

00:47:47.857 --> 00:47:50.527
for our living when he couldn't even run his business.

00:47:51.697 --> 00:47:54.637
Sure. Maybe he does look down on you.

00:47:55.837 --> 00:47:58.137
But weren't we the same way back in the day?

00:47:58.837 --> 00:48:00.737
When my father would scold me or nag,

00:48:01.207 --> 00:48:02.707
I'd think to myself,

00:48:03.377 --> 00:48:06.207
"He should get his own act together. He doesn't know what he's saying."

00:48:06.847 --> 00:48:08.647
- You know? - Yes.

00:48:09.247 --> 00:48:11.647
We thought the same about our dads, deep down. Yes.

00:48:12.647 --> 00:48:15.857
Kids are just harsher by nature.

00:48:16.657 --> 00:48:18.127
We were kids once ourselves,

00:48:18.727 --> 00:48:19.727

Did you time your arrival just for his office opening?

00:48:46.687 --> 00:48:48.557
Of course. It's the company I'll be working for.

00:48:50.017 --> 00:48:51.127
What did you say?

00:48:51.857 --> 00:48:54.757
I got scouted by Ji Hyuk.

00:48:55.357 --> 00:48:58.867
You know I was taking film classes when I wanted to be a director?

00:48:58.997 --> 00:49:01.467
He asked me to take videos and pictures of the sites...

00:49:01.467 --> 00:49:03.937
and handle the company's PR and marketing.

00:49:05.067 --> 00:49:06.337
When?

00:49:06.567 --> 00:49:09.237
- Why didn't you tell me? - What?

00:49:09.777 --> 00:49:11.777
I was just still thinking about it.

That's great, Su Jeong!

This is CEO Lee Ji Hyuk's office. And over there is the break room,

00:50:30.617 --> 00:50:33.357

What's all this?

00:51:24.277 --> 00:51:27.047
These are things I'd been collecting to use for interior decorating.

It's a housewarming gift for the new office.

00:51:37.117 --> 00:51:38.387
Why would you do something like this?

00:51:39.657 --> 00:51:42.927
I wanted to design the whole office in a hanok style,

00:51:43.157 --> 00:51:45.867
but it would've been too expensive, so I tried to give it that vibe.

00:51:46.967 --> 00:51:48.837
You always liked hanoks, didn't you?

00:51:49.697 --> 00:51:50.967
Why do you remember that?

00:51:53.037 --> 00:51:54.267
Why are you so concerned with what I like?

Why would you...

00:51:59.377 --> 00:52:02.647
But when I started interior design, you got me all the tools I needed,

00:52:03.117 --> 00:52:06.047
including coloured pencils, sketchbooks, a laser measuring tool,

00:52:06.117 --> 00:52:08.717
a tape measure, and a protractor. You bought me everything...

00:52:11.257 --> 00:52:13.457
So why can't I do the same for you?

- We're business partners. - No. You can't.

00:52:19.967 --> 00:52:21.437
You shouldn't have done this.

00:52:22.597 --> 00:52:25.107
You shouldn't have even remembered that I like the hanok style.

Why do things I haven't asked for? It messes with my head.

00:52:29.007 --> 00:52:30.507
When you do this, it makes me...

Eun Oh didn't do anything wrong.

00:53:28.297 --> 00:53:29.337
It's my fault.

That's not love. Are you really in love with her?

could be mine. And that I'm going crazy, Seong Jae.

Before I go and humiliate myself,

00:55:22.247 --> 00:55:23.717

is something wrong at the company?

Tell me. I'll help if I can.

I don't think you can help. No one can.

00:57:42.687 --> 00:57:44.727

00:57:56.067 --> 00:57:58.637
to see you and Ji Hyuk together in this new space.

00:58:01.407 --> 00:58:02.477
Really?

00:58:05.447 --> 00:58:07.507
So, on a scale, where does Ji Hyuk stand now?

00:58:08.917 --> 00:58:11.587
When the wedding fiasco happened, he was probably a zero,

00:58:12.747 --> 00:58:14.817
but before that, he was probably a 110 out of 100.

00:58:18.957 --> 00:58:21.727
I've never really thought about it in those terms, but...

00:58:22.757 --> 00:58:25.467
he's somewhere above 0 and below 110.

00:58:26.197 --> 00:58:27.297
Something like that, I guess.

00:58:27.927 --> 00:58:29.567
Time heals all wounds, they say.

00:58:32.567 --> 00:58:35.107
"Time heals all wounds?"

00:58:37.077 --> 00:58:39.247
If you get this worked up over every little thing with Eun Oh,

00:58:39.777 --> 00:58:41.547
how did you manage to be her Daddy Long Legs?

00:58:42.317 --> 00:58:44.747
For all those years. For so long.

00:58:45.347 --> 00:58:48.487
That's not love. How could you hold back for years?

00:58:57.827 --> 00:58:58.927
Director Park.

00:59:04.197 --> 00:59:05.607
I should get going now.

00:59:06.307 --> 00:59:07.667
You're leaving already?

00:59:07.837 --> 00:59:10.737
Yes, I had some work to do. I just popped in for a minute.

00:59:28.697 --> 00:59:30.097
I blew it.

00:59:37.637 --> 00:59:38.967
I really blew it.

00:59:44.437 --> 00:59:45.547
Yes?

00:59:54.647 --> 00:59:55.857
About earlier...

00:59:57.457 --> 00:59:58.527
I'm sorry.

01:00:00.687 --> 01:00:01.857
And your explanation?

01:00:03.497 --> 01:00:04.497
I'll give you one.

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:06.227
Soon.

01:00:07.427 --> 01:00:08.437
Soon?

01:00:08.767 --> 01:00:10.437
Seong Jae is going to confess his feelings to you.

01:00:10.797 --> 01:00:13.137
And then, whether you accept him or not,

01:00:13.837 --> 01:00:14.907
I'll tell you.

01:00:15.377 --> 01:00:16.737
About how I feel.

01:00:22.977 --> 01:00:24.447
Here's the final quote.

01:00:42.697 --> 01:00:46.807
You can move in within a week. You really lucked out.

01:00:46.807 --> 01:00:49.107
A couple of other companies were eyeing this spot.

01:00:49.677 --> 01:00:50.937
It's a great location.

01:00:51.137 --> 01:00:53.447
- Then let's go sign the contract. - Okay.

01:00:55.717 --> 01:00:58.547
It seems AP Group has been up for sale.

01:00:58.547 --> 01:01:00.917
- An article just came out today. - AP Group?

01:01:00.987 --> 01:01:02.717
(Leading Materials Company Quietly Prepares for Sale)

01:01:02.787 --> 01:01:03.787
(However, this massive conglomerate...)

01:01:08.157 --> 01:01:09.257
Yes?

01:01:10.697 --> 01:01:14.497
- Mr. Jo? - Have you heard from Mr. Lee?

01:01:14.497 --> 01:01:15.867
No, I haven't.

01:01:16.297 --> 01:01:19.007
He said he'd be back after signing.

01:01:19.007 --> 01:01:21.037
It's been over three hours. He's not even picking up.

01:01:21.537 --> 01:01:23.077
- Really? - Yes.

01:01:23.077 --> 01:01:25.647
And the logo and nameplates arrived.

01:01:26.207 --> 01:01:27.307
Okay.

01:01:28.447 --> 01:01:29.517
(CEO Lee Ji Hyuk)

01:01:29.517 --> 01:01:32.317
- It's Mr. Lee. - Quick, answer it.

01:01:32.917 --> 01:01:35.687
- Hello, Mr. Lee? - Is the logo and nameplate up yet?

01:01:36.317 --> 01:01:38.627
The package just got here. I was about to put them up.

01:01:38.627 --> 01:01:39.727
Don't hang anything up.

01:01:40.957 --> 01:01:41.997
What?

01:01:41.997 --> 01:01:43.997
Get everyone to the conference room.

01:01:44.357 --> 01:01:45.527
I'll be there in ten minutes.

01:01:52.307 --> 01:01:54.067
I have no idea what this is about.

01:01:58.707 --> 01:02:01.047
Maybe the deal for the showroom fell through?

01:02:01.877 --> 01:02:03.777
If that were the case, he would've come straight here.

01:02:09.357 --> 01:02:11.317
Mr. Lee, what's going on?

01:02:12.727 --> 01:02:13.827
Well...

01:02:14.427 --> 01:02:16.757
I have an announcement to make.

01:02:18.767 --> 01:02:20.027
You all know AP Group, right?

01:02:20.727 --> 01:02:22.167
The all-in-one interior materials company.

01:02:23.067 --> 01:02:25.867
That same AP Group has been put up for sale.

01:02:27.007 --> 01:02:28.377
And so...

01:02:29.877 --> 01:02:32.607
I've decided to acquire it.

01:03:20.327 --> 01:03:22.757
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:22.905 --> 01:03:24.205
AP Group?

01:03:24.265 --> 01:03:26.805
It's like a corner store owner saying he'll buy a department store.

01:03:26.805 --> 01:03:30.875
Why are you angry I'm marrying a man from a higher-status family?

01:03:30.875 --> 01:03:34.075
- What's it to you? - "Concern." Ever heard of it?

01:03:34.275 --> 01:03:37.315
- You don't even do that, you fool. - Why, you little...

01:03:37.315 --> 01:03:39.755
Eun Chae! What do you think you're doing?

01:03:39.755 --> 01:03:42.525
Su Bin, why'd you just take that? Are you a fool?

01:03:42.525 --> 01:03:46.225
You'll be in trouble if anyone finds out you got me the job.

01:03:46.225 --> 01:03:49.465
Eun Oh, I've been thinking about something.

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:52.635
What if they weren't abandoned, but were lost instead?
