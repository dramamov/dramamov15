[Episode 4]

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.560
You long to see the scenery outside

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.360
and to get out of that Palanquin.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.900
Who would've known...

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.000
that you'd end up blind?

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.680
Why don't you be my eyes?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.930
Everything outside must be beautiful

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.960
because...

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.930
you sound so happy.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.970
You're hundreds of years old.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.840
How can you still be like a child,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.160
falling asleep the moment
your head hits the pillow?

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.400
[Lu Qiba, Raccoon Dog Demon]

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.930
How can you sleep so deeply?

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.960
Fine.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.050
Keep sleeping.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.820
You won't get to eat it.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.790
[Lu Shangxia, Raccoon Dog Demon]

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.110
Who? Who was that? Who...

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:20.810
Pretending.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.000
Still pretending with me?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.560
I'm not.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.290
Give it to me!

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.090
Alright.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.079
Give you what?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.470
Give it to me!

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.470
You're the fastest

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.329
but the dumbest raccoon dog demon

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.840
in your clan,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.590
Lu Qiba.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.430
The other one is your brother,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.030
who is even dumber than you:

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.240
Lu Shangxia.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.590
I heard that you two

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.990
couldn't stay
in the raccoon dog demon clan

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.800
because you opposed
using the winged spirit pearl.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.520
So now

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.120
you two wander around performing for a living.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.590
How miserable.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.840
This man is

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.560
quite rich.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.280
Qiba,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.140
how about we...

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.560
What?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.360
You want to kill me?

[Quan Rumu, Young Master
of the Quan Family of the Borderlands]

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.600
We d-didn't offend you, did we?

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.310
Yeah.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.790
Wh-Why did you come to us?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.560
What do you want from us?

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.160
Enough.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.550
I want you to do something for me.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.510
Help me find and follow this person,

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.370
and report his whereabouts to me.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.250
Where to find me

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.360
is also written clearly on the note.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.950
Th-Th-This job

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.770
is not...

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.720
not easy.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.270
Yeah.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.680
This will involve food and lodging...

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.950
Th-Th-This job

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.190
is going to cost a lot of money.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.159
It's not an easy task.

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.750
Enough.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.000
Don't be cheeky.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.640
How much do you want?

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.280
Fi-Fi-Five hundred taels!

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.000
Yeah.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.440
Five hundred taels?

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.720
Forget about 500 taels—

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.640
I don't even have five taels.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.310
Are you kidding us?

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.800
When you raccoon dog demons court mates,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.190
you rely on

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.040
the small braid
after transforming into human form, right?

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.900
Growing a braid

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.680
takes a very, very long time.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.420
And without it,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.630
you'd basically be like

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.030
a eunuch among us humans,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.630
right?

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.870
I'll kill you!

My braid...

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.480
I'll keep

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.810
your braid safe for you.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.720
Come to me after the task is done.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.159
I'll definitely help you reattach it

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:40.000
perfectly.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.770

Young Master Fugui,

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.440
I've never seen such a big lake before.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.000
When spring comes next year,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.560
this place will surely be
even more beautiful.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.270
By then,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.740
let's come back to see it together, okay?

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.850
Young Master Fugui.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.630
Don't worry.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.130
I know how to weave brocade.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.630
By that time,

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.680
I'll weave this entire scene
into a brocade.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.750
When your eyes heal,

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.010
I'll show it all to you.

This is an Aura Concealment Talisman.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.120
It can temporarily conceal
your demonic aura.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.120
At the Li Residence, you must be cautious
at all times.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.190
Yes, Young Master Fugui.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:18.950
I will

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.040
keep the talisman on me at all times.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.160

that you're a maid
arranged for me by Mr. Fei.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.510
Once inside the Li Residence,

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.120
you'll stay in the guest room.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.180
Try to meet as few people as possible.

held once every 36 years
by our Yiqi Alliance.

acts as host.

Master, we've found
the Young Master's whereabouts.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.720
After the prescribed competitions,

those who excel will be chosen

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.480
to observe the secret Spiritual Stone left

At the same time, the Yiqi Alliance will

carefully guide them
to become pillars of the alliance.

It's so difficult for me

to see you even once.

what are you talking about?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.840
I was just heading to
the Blue Sky Convention.

Then why didn't you go there with me?

for nothing.

what do you want me to do?

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.970

that even though the Soldier is blind
for now,

he's still invincible.

The Soldier of Wangquan Manor...

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.390
Wangquan Fugui.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.750
He shall challenge all of today's victors
in the Combat Contest.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.480
This is a battle of honor.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.320
The results

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.410
will not affect your advancement
to the next round.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.720
Good luck, everyone.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.600
Everyone,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.240
please draw your swords!

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.000
Rumu.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.050
You're in poor health.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.030
After that strike, you won't be able
to exert any more strength.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.750
Go back with me.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.240
You are my son.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.670
Why can't you just listen to me

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.150
and follow my will?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.360
Would I harm you?

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.240
Everything I do and everything I get—

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.130
won't it all be yours in the future?

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.150
Father...

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.030
So it turns out you love me.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:35.360
Fine.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.320
How about I tell you

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.910
some stories about

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.430
how you, my real father, love me?

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.480
Back then,

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.510
you committed a grave error

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.240
by practicing forbidden arts.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.910
You were expelled from Wangquan Manor

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.840
and exiled to the Western Regions.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.750
You knew full well that I had asthma

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:57.910
and that in that place

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.440
I simply couldn't survive.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.530
The Chief intended to keep me,

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.650
but at that time,

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.440
what did you say?

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.740
Rumu's asthma is severe.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.720
[Young Quan Rumu]

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.210
If he goes with you
to the Western Regions,

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.360
[Grand Ambition Soaring to the Heavens]

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.890
with all that dust and sand,

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.470
I'm afraid he won't survive.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.240
Let him stay.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.790
No need.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.520
Wherever I go,

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:24.510
he goes.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:30.910
Jingting.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.800
If Rumu goes with you,

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.670
he will die.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.270
I won't leave him here with you.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.630
Since he's my son,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.120
in life he's mine,

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.460
and in death his ghost is mine too.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.060
Just like that,

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.120
after we arrived in the Western Regions,

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.790
my asthma grew increasingly severe.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.520
Even surviving was hard for me.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:20.440
And you?

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.840
You began to ignore me,

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.030
killing demons everywhere

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.160
and making enemies.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:37.870
Finally, one day,

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.730
someone captured me
as a hostage for revenge.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.630
At that time, I knew

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.360
that taking me hostage was useless.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.480
My life meant nothing

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.910
to you.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.390
But what you did

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.240
was even worse than I imagined.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.340
Quan Jingting!

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.600
I have your son!

00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.880
Give me back my mother's bones!

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.770
That piece of trash is
of no use to me at all.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.360
Kill him if you want!

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:05.870
Today...

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.480
I'm here to capture you!

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:20.750
After that,

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:24.050
I wandered through the desert
for over 10 years.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.300
Did you ever look for me even once?

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:30.150
You didn't.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.960
Did you care whether I lived or died?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.840
You didn't.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.120
But ever since I became famous
with one sword strike there,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.080
you remembered

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.540
you still had a son like me.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.250
You remembered to love me.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.240
But how did you show this love?

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.500
For the sake of your ambition,

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.330
you took my friends as hostages

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.720
and forced me to work for you.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.240
Father,

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.240
your love is

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.630
more poisonous than arsenic.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:00.520
How dare you!

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.310
You have such strength

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.210
yet possess no grand ambition!

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.940
I've been working hard for so many years.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.230
You are my son.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.790
You should work for me.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.480
Where have you imprisoned them?

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:27.400
Rest assured,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.730
your gang of worthless friends

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.310
is very safe now.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.720
As long as you obediently

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.590
go to the Blue Sky Convention
and defeat the Soldier,

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.070
I'll let them go.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.830
However...

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.640
before that...

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.790
you have to take this first.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.550
In this world,

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.550
what kind of father
would ask his son to take this?

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.350
This is just a pill

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.030
that can greatly boost
your spiritual power.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.400
I want to ensure you win.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.210
Even if I don't eat it...

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.210
I can still defeat the Soldier.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.510
You think I'd believe you?

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.830
If I weren't holding the lives
of your worthless friends

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.350
you made in the Western Regions,

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.450
would you have obediently come with me
to the Blue Sky Convention?

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.480
I know you've been looking for them
these days.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.400
Stop looking.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.030
Even if you find them, it's useless.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.370
What do you mean?

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.440
Do you know what that black liquid

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.680
is?

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.000
Crude oil.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.590
With just a spark,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.970
these worthless friends of yours

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.510
will be burned to ashes.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:18.510
Let us go.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.960
What do you want?

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.890
Don't come over!

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.930
Don't come over!

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.790
Mother!

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:24.960
What do you want?

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.480
Don't come any closer!

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.270
Let us go!

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.720
No!

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.200
No!

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.510
Father!

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:36.830
Mother!

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.000
No!

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.170
True Dragon Power?

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.310
You wretch,

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.650
say goodbye
to these worthless friends of yours.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.920
Wait!

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.580
I'll eat it.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.720
Now that's my good boy.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.880
Today's Combat Contest is already over.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.720
The evening banquet will start soon.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.550
Go attend

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:03.880
and make up for

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.680
your willful absence earlier.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.960
This is the chamber
specially prepared for you, Soldier.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.240
There's also a side chamber inside

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.830
for your maid.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.000
Thank you.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.960
Young Master Fugui,

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.720
you must be very tired
from today's martial arts contest.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.750
Rest for a bit.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.750
You still have the banquet
to attend tonight.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:39.200
Okay.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:58.960
Come on.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.480
To you.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.750
This year's young competitors

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:17.590
are very good.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:18.960
Hongye,

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.440
indeed, they're good.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.400
But compared to us back in our day,

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.130
they still fall a little short.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:33.350
Muhai,

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.940
let the banquet begin.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:36.480
Everyone!

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.350
Didn't you say

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.900
you're hosting honored guests tonight?

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.920
Then why...

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.850
is there no seat for me?

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.810
Who might you be?

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:51.750
Good evening, Uncle.

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:54.270
I, Rumu, missed today's competition,

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:55.440
so I've come specially to ask you

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.370
for the qualification
for tomorrow's competition.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.700
The Blue Sky Convention aims to
select future talents.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.160
If you want to participate,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.160
just ask them.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.160
Everyone!

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.720
I'm Quan Rumu.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.630
I've come a long way for this.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:26.640
Please

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.920
do me a favor.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.430
Today's banquet is only for

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.240
the winners of today's Combat Contest.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.250
They have earned
the Soldier's recognition.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.790
Rumu, you were absent today.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.510
If the Chief allows it outright,

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.030
it would be unfair.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:47.790
That's right.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:52.480
Rumu.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.810
Elder Shouyi is highly respected.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.910
You have to prove yourself

have known each other since childhood?

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.480
I lived at

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:04.810
Wangquan Manor until I was 10.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:07.570
I secretly became his friend
for half a year.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.960
I don't know

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.790
if he made any other friends afterward.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:15.030
Clearly not.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.000
Nice!

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:17.670
Then I'm the Soldier's

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:18.480
only friend.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:22.480
Since you are good friends,

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.440
why did you blind his eyes?

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:28.800
It's a long story.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:30.280
I consented to it.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.360
Not long after you transformed into
human form,

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.360
he came to me.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:41.160
Come out.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:47.930
That day,

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:50.000
you made a spinning stone skip

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.320
right in front of me.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:53.910
Were you trying to tell me

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.630
that after seeing the world,

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.400
I still had to come back?

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.590
Although it's perfect for stone-skipping,

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.360
there are no lakes in the Western Regions.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.820
I still never learned how.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.680
It's been a long time,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:07.590
Rumu.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.590
I've returned it to its owner.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:12.790
It's been a long time.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:15.670
The reason I blinded his eyes

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.280
is that my friends' lives

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.680
are in my father's hands.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.440
He used them to threaten me,

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.110
forcing me to use this filthy method

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.550
to ensure I could defeat him

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:24.920
at the Blue Sky Convention.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.380
So I went to him in advance.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.110
He asked me to blind his eyes

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.040
to keep my father satisfied.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.160
And even if I hadn't done it,

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:34.800
my father would have used
other dirty means

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.930
against him anyway.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.030
So,

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.610
we played along with my father,

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.150
taking advantage of the time he's pacified

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.280
to figure out how to rescue my friends.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.400
Young Master Fugui

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.760
trusts you this much?

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:52.760
Your Fugui and I...

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:59.590
He hasn't received much affection.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.480
So,

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.110
he will cherish it even more.

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.110
You talk too much.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.070
Why haven't those raccoon dog demons
I asked you to find arrived yet?

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:06.710
He

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.110
sought us out to do work for him,

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.030
didn't give us a penny,

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.280
and...

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.960
and even threatened and intimidated us...

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.960
Aren't they here?

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:13.030
How can he do this?

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.410
You're having a little tea party here.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.610
What's so good about roasted oranges?

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.000
Who... who's this?

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.920
Who are they?

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.030
He's blind?

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.550
Did you track that person?

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:24.630
Cut the crap!

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.560
Wh-Where's my braid?

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:30.550
Did you track the person?

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:31.750
Give me back my braid!

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.510
Oh,

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.360
so you didn't track him.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:38.050
Little spider,

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.150
go burn it.

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:40.000
Oh.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.590
Got it.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.540
We tracked... we tracked him.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.540
Why did you all come together?

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.090
Let me tell you,

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.360
we followed him all the way

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.840
to a place called Xiyun Hall.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.000
He went in and never came out after that.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:53.730
So that means

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.400
Xiyun Hall is very suspicious.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:58.230
Suspicious, indeed.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.510
Don't be

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.510
f-fooled by the name—

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.360
there are a lot of people

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:05.560
going in and out.

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:07.070
Besides,

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:07.970
let me tell you,

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.170
there must be

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.590
a cave there.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:13.230
There's a cave in Xiyun Hall?

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.510
Yes.

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.230
And it's v-v-very big.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.110
My father showed me

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.070
the place where they're imprisoned.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:21.930
It's obviously

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:22.800
in a cave.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:25.440
It should be that place.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.230
Yes.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.480
Th-That is the place.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.960
Right there for sure.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.840
Look, I've completed the task.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:35.710
Please give me

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:36.630
my braid back.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.360
I-I-I have to go home.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.360
Well...

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.160
Mr. Piaopiao.

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:42.770
As the saying goes,

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:45.190
"When you help someone,
see it through to the end."

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.000
Could you please

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.330
take them there as well?

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:50.690
Then, when will this ever end?

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.400
Yeah.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.340
Little spider.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.030
Got it.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.320
Go, go, go...

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.320
Fine, I'll go!

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:57.760
Why did I take on this task?

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.220
Gosh...

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.280
How far is Xiyun Hall from here?

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.410
I don't know about you guys,

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:05.320
but at my speed,

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.920
a round trip takes four... four h-hours.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:25.590
Rumu,

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.840
you seem to have something on your mind.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.640
This morning,

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.820
he forced me to take a pill.

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:32.230
He said

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:34.030
it would ensure I defeat you.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.560
But I don't know what it was.

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:38.110
I have a bad feeling about it.

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.840
If I

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.080
do something out of line tomorrow,

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.920
don't hold back.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.030
The world is vast,

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.440
I still have to find
a very important person,

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.040
and I don't want to die at all.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:00.280
But if

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.170
something really goes wrong,

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.000
I still hope

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:06.390
I can die by your hand.

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:10.840
In my brief twenty-some years of life,

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.740
I don't have much I can't let go of.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.130
There's only one thing
I want to ask of you.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.230
If one day you meet a dragon demon

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:21.360
carrying a gourd etched with snowflakes,

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.280
please tell her

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:24.930
that I, Rumu...

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.920
never blamed her.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:43.860
Master.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.440
Wangquan Shouyi's men

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.880
have participated in
the Blue Sky Convention.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.840
Don't let

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.200
any of our men get involved.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.490
Understood.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:53.860
Master,

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:57.190
the Young Master and the Soldier
have known each other since childhood.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:58.150
Do you truly believe

00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:59.590
he can kill the Soldier?

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:08.440
Whether he can or not...

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:12.440
we'll find out tomorrow.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.110
Rumu,

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.480
at tomorrow's Blue Sky Convention,

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.140
you and I will act separately.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.430
You'll go participate in the Skill Contest
and stall for time,

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:33.030
while I'll

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.170
go to Xiyun Hall to save people.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:47.760
You must hold on until I return.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.490
The matter you've entrusted to me

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.400
is still yours to complete.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:56.440
Don't worry.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:58.510
You won't die.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.710
I won't let you die.
