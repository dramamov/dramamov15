Rumu,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.230
let's split up at Blue Sky Convention

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.070
tomorrow.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.140
You go
attend the skill battles and buy time.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.790
And I

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.340
will go to the Xiyun Hall to save them.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.350
You must hang in there until I come back.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.360
You have to do

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.640
what you asked for by yourself.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.500
Here we are.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.490
We've arrived.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.630
Up ahead

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.310
is the X-Xiyun Hall.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.710
Mr. Blind,

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.560
c-can you

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.440
do massages?

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.680
My legs hurt so much.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.610
Could you give me a massage?

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.000
Huh?

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.020
Young Master Fugui doesn't know
how to massage.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.030
But I can do it.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.120
How about

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.840
I give you a massage?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.470
Forget it.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.430
Look at your skinny arm!

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.360
How can you give a nice massage?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.120
Y-You're too weak.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.980
I don't need it.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.120
You must know how

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.380
to tell fortunes, huh?

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.450
Read my fortune.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.770
I feel like I'm having a tough year,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.660
constantly dealing
with those shameless guys.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.020
He can't do fortune-telling either.

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:35.960
Tell me.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.710
What do you want to know?

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.840
Is it about your career

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.430
or marriage?
Why are you so annoying?

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.079
I don't want you to do it.

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:41.840
I want him to tell my fortune.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.870
He's blind, typical of fortune-tellers!

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.670
Stop arguing.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.750
He's not blind.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.690
I asked him to find you.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.079
I find you are even...

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.280
even more shameless.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.190

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.150
regret what you just said

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.430

W-Will I r-regret it?

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.240
Listen carefully.

also known as Lu Piaopiao.

Why are you laughing?

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.240
Are you looking down on me?

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.800
I'll beat you up!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.430

what's going on inside.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.360
I have no idea

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.040
about the exact situation inside.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.570
I didn't dare to go too deep.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.190
But I only know

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.630
that it used to be

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.060
be a tobacco house.

Where is the entrance
to the cave?

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.330
Well...

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.680
H-How could I possibly know that?

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.920
They have hostages.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.870
We can't act rashly.

versus Li Shunqi from the Li family.

The battle begins.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.720
That pill

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.750
has hyped me up

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.250
with a yearning

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.000

You guys are so lame.

You can't achieve anything big.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.600
You're way too stingy.

You asked us out for a mission.

We traveled all the way here,

any wine or water.

You're wearing a dancer's clothes.

Yes.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.720
I saw a dancer

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.870
resting in the room.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.270
I knocked her out

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.560
and put on her outfit.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.630
Wait,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.420
how did you know I changed my clothes?

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.440
Young Master Fugui,

How's your investigation going?

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.650
Oh, right, Young Master Fugui,

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.070
this mansion

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.750
is heavily guarded as expected.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.830
I've been wandering inside
for a long time.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.230
But I still haven't found

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.680
the entrance to the cave.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.070
You scared me.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.270
I thought it was someone else.

Yes?

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.720
Why were you two hiding behind?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.190
I went to take a leak.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.430
Y-Your clothes are pretty.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:59.560
Really?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.090
I can find the entrance to the cave.

Piaopiao,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.080
listen.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:33.870
You can't talk

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.000
after we get inside.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.960
Just do what I say.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.760
Do you hear me?

Come on, let me take a look.

Sorry to put you through this, Piaopiao.

It's all for the rescue,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.550
right?

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.960
You can save whoever you want,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.080
but why did you hit me?

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.320
It wasn't me.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.720
And we'll give you a raise.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.440
You should've told me earlier.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.370
Catch me. Hurry.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.150
Boss.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.150
Boss.

What are you looking at?

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.530
Kneel down!

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.730
Kneel there.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.440
What's going on?

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.890
I just wanted to get some fresh air

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.400
and found that this guy tried to escape.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:10.680
If I'm not mistaken,

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.360
this is the demon brought here
and locked up by Master Quan, right?

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.090
Impossible.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.270
The demons brought by Master Quan

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.730
are all locked in the cave.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.390
And the cave

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.050
is covered by demon-subduing talismans.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:22.910
How did he

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.240
get out?

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.080
These little demons

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.630
know sorcery more or less.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.360
You can't underestimate them.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.890
Thank you, miss.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.950
Take him away.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.220
Do not try to run again.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:36.790
Go.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:53.750
Yi.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:54.840
Yi!

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.420
Stop slacking off.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.750
You lazybones.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.410
How can you earn your freedom?

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.790
Work harder.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.810
Follow me to the stage.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.320
Let's welcome the next challenger,

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.390
the Cold Jade Sword

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.520
from the Shi family,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.200
Shi Tang.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.030
Master,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.640
the Soldier has reached the Xiyun Hall.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.080
Mm.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.610
Everything unfolded just as you predicted.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.400
A father knows his son the best.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.320
Rumu has been friends
with the Soldier since childhood.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.000
He wouldn't hurt his friend

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.600
just because I forced him to.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.320
He went to see the Soldier
without telling me.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.630
But I knew it.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.960
I didn't predict the future.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.600
It's just
that human nature is unpredictable.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.440
I just played along.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.480
You lured the Soldier to my Xiyun Hall

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.150
and made me deal with him.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.210
You also forced Rumu to attend
the Blue Sky Convention.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.120
I suppose

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.750
the Soldier isn't

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.840
the only one you want to kill,

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.000
right?

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.960
He's been outshining me
in every aspect since childhood.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.080
Yes,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.910
Rumu might not be able

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.320
to kill the Soldier.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.040
But what if the person I want Rumu to kill

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.790
is not the Soldier?

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.870
Split them up and destroy them separately.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.530
What a good plan
to kill two birds with one stone.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.150
Now it all depends on
whether the demon king you raise

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.120
can kill the Soldier.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.360
Just rest assured.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.390
Be g-gentle.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.450
You, the one who came in with me,

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.790
your plan

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.740
is indeed quite smart.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.790
If no one informed us

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.760
that someone'd definitely come
to rescue the prisoners today,

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.870
you'd

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.600
pull it off.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.440
The Soldier is here!

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.700
Don't let him get away!

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.670
Hurry up!

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:29.910
Come on! Run!

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:30.510
Go!

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.120
Young lady,

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.630
how dare you, a little demon,

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.550
impersonate one of us?

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.320
Do you know

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.150
who we are?

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.840
Do you know

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.910
who we are?

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.770
You're demons, aren't you?

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.510
Oh,

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.080
young lady,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.240
you know quite a lot.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.750
What if

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.730
I'm not a "young lady" as you said?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.860
You want to die?

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.610
Little spider?

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.630
Don't let her escape!

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.320
Kill her!

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.750
Who are you?

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.400
Be careful, Young Master Fugui.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.000
They are the demon king.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.000
"Young Master Fugui"?

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.150
I know only one powerful swordsman

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.360
called Fugui.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.720
That is

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.720
Wangquan Fugui.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.390
So the target

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.720
we're going to kill today

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.550
is the Soldier?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.130
Young Master Fugui,

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.490
your eyes have really recovered?

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.200
Mm-hmm.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.550
Young Master Fugui,

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.340
you're exactly the one

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.620
I've been waiting for.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.480
Although the Musk Demon King is not
the strongest in the Demon Realm,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.550
she excels in clones and poison.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.050
Unless you kill the original,

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.910
the clones will never die.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:25.720
This time,

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.510
there's no way he can survive.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:49.790
And the musk demon's poisonous miasma.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:50.440
Come on.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.550
It's not only suffocating,

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.240
making him unable to control the sword,

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.720
but it can also
disturb the Soldier's senses.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.870
In such a chaotic environment,

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.070
it's impossible for the Soldier

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.750
to find her.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.670
Young Master Fugui,

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.930
this is poisonous fog.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.960
Hold your breath.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:13.349
No matter how strong a swordsman is,

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.920
he needs to breathe to wield his sword.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.050
How many strikes can you pull off
if you hold your breath?

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.310
Soldier,

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.510
both of you will die in the miasma today!

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.590
I got her!

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.170
Young Master Fugui, are you alright?

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.110
Soldier,

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.350
it's not that easy to kill me.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.160
As long as the real me is safe,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.550
I will never die.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:02.720
Today,

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.430
you're not getting away.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.170
Let me do it!

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:05.920
Don't!

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.070
Master ordered us

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.790
to leave no survivors!

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:27.510
Kill them!

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:29.280
Let's go.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.680
Thanks to you finding her location,

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.880
I was able to kill her.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.070
How did you know

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.480
where that demon king's real body was?

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.050
Young Master Fugui,

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.200
actually, when that demon king

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.530
dragged me to the stage,

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.640
I already found something off about her.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.400
So

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.070
I left something

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.440
on her.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:10.720
I tied my gossamer

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.270
on her wrist.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.160
Never thought

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.410
that would help me find her location.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.480
Young Master Fugui,

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.030
I finally managed to help you.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.030
Did I do a good job?

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.370
I owe you one.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.000
But next time,
you should run away directly.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.790
I don't want you to risk your life.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.430
If I run away,

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.030
what about you, Young Master Fugui?

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.960
They knew I'd come to the Xiyun Hall
to save people.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.270
They even got their own men killed

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.800
just to make sure I die here.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.990
If Quan Jingting made Rumu take the pill

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.480
not for killing me,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.750
then who is his target?

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.090
This pair of talismans

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.790
is an upgraded version
of the Demon-Taming Talisman.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.550
I added something else

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.210
to the Dragon Tempering Pill.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.240
No.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.680
He's targeting my father this time.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.010
Young Master Fugui,

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:30.810
you should hurry back now.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.590
Okay.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.770
I'll go back with my sword.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:37.290
This is too dangerous.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:38.850
Take care of yourself.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.840
Don't come to meet me again.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.830
I am Chi Yan.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.070
Looking forward to a good match.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:04.790
Rumu,

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.550
kill him.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.400
Is Quan Rumu going crazy?

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.860
He wants to kill his rival?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:19.480
Hongye.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.160
He's mad.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:20.920
Go

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.450
send someone to take Rumu away.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.480
Uncle,

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.400
it's your turn now.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.350
Go down!

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.720
Assassin!

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:58.840
Hurry!

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.090
Protect the Chief.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.960
I've been waiting for you.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.640
Rumu,

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.880
I order you

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.770
to kill Wangquan Hongye

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.200
at all costs.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:18.200
Rumu!

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.930
Why is the Soldier still alive?

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.010
Fugui, take the sword!

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.110
Rumu!

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:48.790
Wake up!

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.280
Why is he emitting
such a strong demonic aura?

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:52.880
Father,

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.200
why can't I use the Divine Fire,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.110
although I have
the Dongfang family's bloodline?

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.830
Maybe because your mother
had little spiritual power

00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.920
[In Memory of Beloved Wife
Dongfang Huaizhu]

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.960
when she gave birth to you.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:02.960
Why do you ask so?

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.720
Because I recently found
that all the flames

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.980
seem to be afraid of me.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.640
But I can't control them.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.120
The Dongfang Divine Fire

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.970
is the mightiest in the world.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.400
Once the Divine Fire blazes,

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.350
all evil flees.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.510
It's fine if you can't use that fire.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.000
Without it,

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.550
your mother wouldn't have died.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.830
Practice your swordplay harder.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:24.760
and keep it pure.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.400
Only in this way

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.520
can you forge the Heart of Sword

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.570
and complete the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:45.530
The Dongfang Divine Fire is the nemesis
of all evil things.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:46.070
Rumu,

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.030
I will keep you safe.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.400
This is...

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.440
The aura of the Purest Sun Flame!

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.880
The Soldier is the Soldiers.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:03.070
Hang in there.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:09.160
Chief,

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.000
these people must've taken some evil drug.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.460
It's extremely powerful,

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:14.680
making people lose their minds

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.680
and grow stronger

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.280
into a fighting machine.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.000
Investigate these assassins' identities.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:23.960
Their weapons,

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.030
clothes, and moves

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.050
will all leave some clues.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:28.040
Understood.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.680
Quzhuo,

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.340
you're a pro in elixirs and pills.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.370
Come take a look.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:38.200
Okay.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:58.640
You...

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.000
Chief,

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:13.270
I'm guilty.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:15.270
I was eager to win.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.310
To help Rumu win the Blue Sky Convention,

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.570
I went to the Xiyun Hall

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.720
and bought the so-called elixir

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.430
that could improve power
from Elder Wangquan.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:25.750
I didn't expect

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.010
that he'd attempt to kill you ruthlessly

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.930
with such a horrendous scheme!

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:32.970
This drug can indeed boost power.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:33.880
Besides,

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.510
it's mixed with talismans that can control

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.750
a person's mind,
like the Demon-Taming Talisman.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.160
It can deprive them of all senses,
make them feel no pain,

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.200
and turn them into a killing machine.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.350
The master-talisman holder

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:44.610
should be at the scene.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.350
Muhai,

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:47.610
go check it out.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:49.030
Yes.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Why did this thing

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.280
appear in our Yiqi Alliance again?

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.110
Wangquan Hongye,

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.440
I only sent a small gift into the circle.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.480
Never thought

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.070
it could really lead to the infighting
within the Yiqi Alliance

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.330
and cause huge losses.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.830
The Yiqi Alliance
that you desperately try to protect

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.240
looks pathetic.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:30.240
You had a narrow escape today,

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.790
but the show

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.440
has just begun.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:35.880
The drug they took

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:37.830
is called Chakuwa.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:39.950
It's worth ten taels of gold.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.240
I bought the Dragon Tempering Pill.
It's worth 1,000 taels of gold.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.440
Did you participate in the chaos

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.200
caused by Wangquan Shouyi?

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:49.750
No.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.200
I just wanted Rumu to defeat the Soldier

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.680
and return to the Wangquan family.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.790
Is that all?

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.070
Also,

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:07.790
I want to reclaim

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.240
my surname, Wangquan.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:13.350
I admit

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.690
that I was used by Wangquan Shouyi

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.140
and almost had Rumu
make a terrible mistake.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.880
If you must punish me,

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.880
please sentence me to death.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.240
Rumu and I

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.840
just won't return to the Western Regions.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.750
Because of Rumu,

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.860
I already gave you a chance

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.200
over ten years ago.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.270
Then please

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:53.240
forgive Rumu one more time.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.960
To atone for my sins, I'm willing

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.610
to enter and guard the Sword Tomb.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.110
You may leave.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.240
Quzhuo,

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.790
send someone to investigate the Xiyun Hall

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.720
and look for
Wangquan Shouyi's accomplices.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.200
Okay.

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.040
Lock up Quan Jingting immediately

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.400
and escort him to guard the Sword Tomb.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:02.750
Young Master Rumu will be fine

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:03.750
after he wakes up.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.240
But,

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.570
Soldier, your injuries

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.310
should be

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.730
paid more attention to.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.740
I got it. You may leave.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:34.490
Hongye,

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:35.070
[Auspice from the East]

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.070
I've taken care

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.750
of both the Soldier and Rumu

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:40.410
and got them the best physician
of the Li family.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.200
Now that things have come to this point,

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:45.240
let's cancel

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.380
tomorrow's mind battles.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:51.070
When Rumu gets better,

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:51.830
we will

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.570
immediately return

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:54.850
to the Wangquan Manor.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.160
Hongye,

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.760
aren't you going to check in on him?

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.000
Actually, the Soldier

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.830
is hurt worse than Rumu.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.320
He

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.360
has his own way to go.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.560
Spoiling him too much

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.000
will only harm him.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.190
Young Master Fugui asked me to leave

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.070
because there was danger
in the Blue Sky Convention.

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:28.000
He was afraid
that I'd get dragged into it, too.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.510
I wonder how he's doing right now.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.040
I must go back to take a look.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.010
Come out.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.030
The courtyard

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.690
is full of wintersweet trees.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.190
And today,

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:55.590
it happens to be snowing.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.670
Would you like

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:57.870
to take a look with me?

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:58.920
No.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.440
Wait,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.960
why are you

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.920
so...

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:07.440
So boring?

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.920
You want me to stay still here

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.850
and say thank you

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.960
to you?

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.630
Good idea.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.130
I'm injured.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:18.410
You stabbed me.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:26.410
After having that little spider,

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:27.280
Fugui,

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:30.960
you've become a bit mischievous, I think.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:33.810
Young Master Fugui...

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:35.800
Young Master Fugui!

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.610
Young Master Fugui.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.110
Are you hurt?

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.770
Thank goodness.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.440
Seeing you alright,

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.190
I can put my mind at ease.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.630
There's an outsider here.

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:52.550
Be quiet.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:03.630
I see.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.030
Young Master Fugui,

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.710
I know you don't want me back

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.820
because you're afraid it's dangerous here.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.190
But...

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.670
But we've agreed

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:17.320
that I'll only leave after I learn a set

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.720
of sword moves
to be able to protect myself.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.230
I...

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.920
I haven't mastered it yet.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.320
So...

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.880
So,

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.670
I can't leave.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.030
C-Can I stay?

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.140
Little spider,

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.760
let me tell you another secret.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:37.950
It can make you

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.030
stay here no matter what.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.230
What secret?

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:42.190
Shut up.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.760
No.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.920
I must say it.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.590
You could transform into a human,
all thanks to him.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:49.320
What he did

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.480
would shorten his life by ten years.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:53.760
I don't know

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.840
why he did that.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.190
Anyway, now we both

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.190
owe you our lives.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:36:59.800
As the saying goes,

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.800
as long as you are thick-skinned,

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.510
you can let go of grudges and gratitude.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:04.190
I'm not

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.450
expressing my gratitude for now.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.010
Take your time to feel touched.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:11.760
As an outsider,

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.850
I'm leaving now.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:22.920
Ten years?

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:29.480
But...

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.490
Young Master Fugui,

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:40.480
why?

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.160
Because I saw you striving to survive.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.060
I don't want you to be crushed by fate.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:51.480
But Young Master Fugui,

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.160
you'd lose ten years of your lifespan!

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.810
If it were other creatures,
