00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:52.240
Park Gyeong-tae.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.996
Kim Nak-su.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.414
-It's you! Cool!
-I told you.

00:00:59.498 --> 00:01:00.666
-Good!
-We have one vote.

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:02.167
Park Gyeong-tae.

00:01:03.377 --> 00:01:04.461
Park Gyeong-tae.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.922
-Yes!
-Park Gyeong-tae.

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:09.216
-Park Gyeong-tae.
-Park Gyeong-tae.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.009
-Park Gyeong-tae!
-Quiet now.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:13.553
Park Gyeong-tae.

00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:18.558
-Yes!
-Park Gyeong-tae.

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:22.604
PARK GYEONG-TAE
KIM NAK-SU

00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:25.440
The class president for this semester

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.359
is Gyeong-tae.

00:01:27.442 --> 00:01:29.403
And Nak-su is the vice president.

00:01:29.486 --> 00:01:30.696
Why don't you stand up?

00:01:31.697 --> 00:01:33.657
-You too, Nak-su.
-It's okay, Nak-su.

00:01:35.617 --> 00:01:37.202
Give them a round of applause.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.208
-Gyeong-tae! Park Gyeong-tae!
-Gyeong-tae! Park Gyeong-tae!

00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:46.628
-Park Gyeong-tae!
-Congratulations, Nak-su.

00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:51.174
-Kim Nak-su!
-Kim Nak-su!

00:01:51.258 --> 00:01:53.677
Our class vice president is Kim Nak-su.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.637
-Kim Nak-su!
-Kim Nak-su!

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:58.682
Mom!

00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:07.649
Mom, I'm the class vice president!

00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:10.193
What? Vice president?

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.195
Yes.

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.615
You ran all the way here just because
you got elected vice president?

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:17.534
Wash your hands and sit.

00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:18.869
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.406
Yes, I ran just because
I got elected vice president. So what?

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:02.454
I'm moving up to managing director, bro.
I'll be an executive soon.

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:03.955
Goodness.

00:03:04.623 --> 00:03:06.583
Time for breakfast!

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:07.542
Coming.

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:12.923
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:22.849
-How's the braised kimchi stew?
-I'd say B-minus.

00:03:23.642 --> 00:03:25.268
I guess you're getting old too.

00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:27.938
You used to season it perfectly before.

00:03:29.022 --> 00:03:32.192
I heard the side dish stores
do morning deliveries every day.

00:03:34.277 --> 00:03:36.863
I just don't want you to work too hard.

00:03:36.947 --> 00:03:38.573
It's good. It's not bad.

00:03:38.657 --> 00:03:40.909
Do you also not like it?

00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:46.289
-I like it. It's delicious.
-Okay.

00:03:46.373 --> 00:03:48.959
He eats just about anything.
No wonder he's so tall.

00:03:56.216 --> 00:03:59.594
Son, you and your friends
must talk about it, right?

00:04:00.262 --> 00:04:03.348
"Just one more shot, and we could get
into Seoul National University."

00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:04.850
-Right?
-No, we don't.

00:04:07.602 --> 00:04:08.687
No one says that?

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.773
They all seem happy.
They also said the campus is pretty.

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:15.902
-How about you?
-I feel the same.

00:04:22.534 --> 00:04:23.952
Don't we have plain barley tea?

00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:26.538
Why do you keep steeping things
in the water?

00:04:27.163 --> 00:04:28.415
It's good for you.

00:04:28.498 --> 00:04:30.709
It's sour.

00:04:40.927 --> 00:04:42.762
-I'm off.
-Okay.

00:04:43.388 --> 00:04:44.264
Let's go.

00:04:47.183 --> 00:04:49.477
-Bye, Mom.
-Wait.

00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:50.687
Hang on a minute.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.399
Wait for me. I'll go with you.

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.404
It's a good day.

00:05:05.452 --> 00:05:06.828
Let me.

00:05:06.912 --> 00:05:08.955
Gosh. Thank you.

00:05:10.248 --> 00:05:12.250
Why can't you throw it out
before it piles up?

00:05:13.752 --> 00:05:15.378
THE

00:05:15.462 --> 00:05:17.047

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.715

00:05:18.798 --> 00:05:20.467
MR. KIM

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.555
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.105
All right!

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:46.868
EPISODE 1
THRESHOLD

00:05:50.205 --> 00:05:52.374
I'll shoot you a link later.

00:05:52.457 --> 00:05:54.542
Don't forget to apply by Friday.

00:05:54.626 --> 00:05:55.961
What is it for?

00:05:56.044 --> 00:05:58.129
The company runs a marketing program

00:05:58.213 --> 00:05:59.714
for college students.

00:05:59.798 --> 00:06:02.676
It's like an ambassador role.

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.886
It will be great for your resume.

00:06:06.012 --> 00:06:08.807
Work experience at my company
gets recognized everywhere.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.059
You can drop me off over there, Dad.

00:06:11.726 --> 00:06:12.644
Okay.

00:06:17.941 --> 00:06:19.359
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:21.027
By Friday.

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:29.995
You should answer me.

00:06:36.042 --> 00:06:37.127
Jeez.

00:06:38.461 --> 00:06:39.879
What a good-looking kid.

00:07:07.657 --> 00:07:08.908
Hello.

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:12.871

MANAGING DIRECTOR
BAEK JEONG-TAE

00:08:52.345 --> 00:08:53.888
"Director Kim Nak-su."

00:08:54.514 --> 00:08:56.808
"We're ready to begin the meeting, sir."

00:08:56.891 --> 00:08:59.102
"Okay, I'll be out soon."

00:09:20.707 --> 00:09:22.125
PERSONNEL TRANSFER NOTICE

00:09:23.042 --> 00:09:25.211
I couldn't go, but you two…

00:09:28.965 --> 00:09:31.092
The food at the party was so good!

00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:33.219
-Right?
-At my daughter's party,

00:09:33.303 --> 00:09:35.054
-Myung-heon was…
-You're so lucky, Myung-heon.

00:09:35.138 --> 00:09:37.140
I'd never won anything like that before.

00:09:37.682 --> 00:09:39.267
He even danced.

00:09:42.729 --> 00:09:43.938
That's hilarious.

00:09:58.953 --> 00:09:59.829
Mr. Kim.

00:09:59.913 --> 00:10:01.164
-Hi.
-Hello.

00:10:01.247 --> 00:10:02.540
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:10:03.499 --> 00:10:05.460
Okay, then.

00:10:07.837 --> 00:10:10.798
Looks like Team 2 all came in early today.

00:10:10.882 --> 00:10:13.426
Yes, we came in an hour early
and held a morning get-together.

00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:14.928
It was more of a breakfast meeting.

00:10:15.011 --> 00:10:16.930
The place we went to today was amazing.

00:10:17.013 --> 00:10:18.014
Was it?

00:10:18.097 --> 00:10:19.599
SALES TEAM 2 GENERAL MANAGER
DO JIN-WOO

00:10:19.682 --> 00:10:22.268
Your team seems to do
a lot of fun activities.

00:10:22.352 --> 00:10:23.269
Let's go.

00:10:23.353 --> 00:10:25.313
Is Mr. Baek in his office already?

00:10:25.396 --> 00:10:27.232
-We should say hello--
-That's…

00:10:27.315 --> 00:10:29.484
He told me he had some instructions
for me this morning,

00:10:29.567 --> 00:10:30.777
-so I--
-I'll just say hi.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.279
He seems very tired. Let's go.

00:10:33.363 --> 00:10:34.572
We should quickly say hello--

00:10:34.656 --> 00:10:36.824
-Let's go.
-Hang on.

00:10:37.533 --> 00:10:39.035
He's not there.

00:10:39.118 --> 00:10:40.870
-He's not?
-No. I was just looking around.

00:10:40.954 --> 00:10:43.081
-Looking around?
-Yes, around Mr. Baek's office.

00:10:43.164 --> 00:10:44.666
What?

00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:47.543
Mr. Baek and I are close enough.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.213
I'm sure.

00:10:50.296 --> 00:10:51.589
Move. What are you all doing?

00:10:54.175 --> 00:10:55.134
Jeez.

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:01.391
What was that?

00:11:02.016 --> 00:11:03.518
-Are you okay?
-Mr. Kim!

00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:05.561
-Mr. Kim!
-Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

00:11:05.645 --> 00:11:07.146
Oh my gosh.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.065
-Are you okay, Mr. Kim?
-Goodness.

00:11:09.148 --> 00:11:11.651
-You don't seem okay.
-I'm okay. Jeez.

00:11:12.193 --> 00:11:13.611
I'm fine.

00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:15.780
I think you broke something.

00:11:15.863 --> 00:11:17.115
I heard a crack.

00:11:24.914 --> 00:11:25.832
What?

00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:28.042
Damn it.

00:11:49.063 --> 00:11:51.733
AWARD, SALES TEAM
PERFECT ATTENDANCE AWARD, KIM NAK-SU

00:11:51.816 --> 00:11:52.859
EXCELLENCE AWARD
KIM NAK-SU

00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:02.160
GENERAL MANAGER KIM NAK-SU

00:12:02.243 --> 00:12:04.704
Mr. Baek's bag is

00:12:04.787 --> 00:12:06.748
not this one.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.084
Is it this one? No.

00:12:10.168 --> 00:12:11.377
Found it.

00:12:13.171 --> 00:12:14.714
Three million won?

00:12:17.133 --> 00:12:19.510
I'll just think of it
as my early promotion present.

00:12:19.594 --> 00:12:23.973
But I'll buy something a little cheaper.
Around two million won.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.605
-Good morning, Mr. Kim.
-Hello.

00:12:30.688 --> 00:12:32.565
Good morning.

00:12:33.316 --> 00:12:34.859
I guess you stopped by a cafe.

00:12:35.777 --> 00:12:36.736
Yes,

00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:39.113
we ran into each other at the station
and stopped by one.

00:12:39.197 --> 00:12:41.032
Did you now?

00:12:41.115 --> 00:12:44.827
We all know
you prefer the instant coffee mix anyway.

00:12:44.911 --> 00:12:47.872
Wrong. I enjoy regular coffee
if someone buys me one.

00:12:47.955 --> 00:12:49.832
I'll remember that!

00:12:49.916 --> 00:12:51.084
It's three minutes

00:12:51.626 --> 00:12:52.752
past 9:00.

00:12:56.589 --> 00:12:57.507
I apologize.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.466
-Sorry, sir.
-Sorry.

00:12:58.549 --> 00:13:01.844
The staff lounge is stocked
with Starbucks capsules.

00:13:01.928 --> 00:13:04.764
Shouldn't you show
a little more interest in the company?

00:13:10.186 --> 00:13:12.522
-Sung-gu!
-Assistant Manager Jung Sung-gu!

00:13:12.605 --> 00:13:14.315
How much did you pay for your bag?

00:13:16.359 --> 00:13:18.194
-This one?
-Yes.

00:13:21.447 --> 00:13:22.490
You mean the price?

00:13:22.573 --> 00:13:23.533
Yes.

00:13:24.909 --> 00:13:25.785
It's…

00:13:25.868 --> 00:13:26.953
It's 2.5 million won.

00:13:27.036 --> 00:13:28.496
Two point…

00:13:29.705 --> 00:13:30.665
Two point…

00:13:31.416 --> 00:13:33.000
I'm sorry. A bit excessive, isn't it?

00:13:33.084 --> 00:13:35.503
No, I didn't mean that.

00:13:35.586 --> 00:13:38.589
A bag like that isn't surprising
for a big-company assistant manager.

00:13:38.673 --> 00:13:40.967
Good morning to you all!

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.218
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:13:42.301 --> 00:13:43.302
Hello, sir.

00:13:43.386 --> 00:13:44.637
-Hello.
-Hi.

00:13:45.263 --> 00:13:47.557
SALES DIRECTOR
BAEK JEONG-TAE (EMPLOYED 27 YEARS)

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.392
-Nak-su.
-Yes, sir.

00:13:49.475 --> 00:13:50.435
Right.

00:13:51.352 --> 00:13:53.104
Have another happy day, everyone!

00:13:53.187 --> 00:13:54.522
-Bye, sir.
-Bye, sir.

00:13:54.605 --> 00:13:56.107
-Bye, sir.
-Sir.

00:13:57.608 --> 00:13:58.776
Come in.

00:14:00.403 --> 00:14:01.279
Take a seat.

00:14:08.744 --> 00:14:09.912
Hello, Jin-woo.

00:14:10.413 --> 00:14:11.456
Hello.

00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:17.086
-Nak-su.
-Yes.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.131
On Saturday, the sales directors
of the three major telecoms

00:14:20.214 --> 00:14:21.215
are having a golf round.

00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:23.426
"Saturday golf with the major three."

00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:25.970
-So the big issue that day will be…
-Yes, sir.

00:14:26.053 --> 00:14:29.182
It looks like the government will continue
to tighten its budget.

00:14:29.265 --> 00:14:32.768
And if the three companies engage
in a bidding war for every public tender,

00:14:32.852 --> 00:14:34.228
we'll wipe ourselves out.

00:14:34.312 --> 00:14:36.522
-It--
-Right. It's all cutthroat these days.

00:14:36.606 --> 00:14:38.107
Exactly.

00:14:38.191 --> 00:14:40.443
To put it nicely, it's like a social club.

00:14:40.526 --> 00:14:41.986
"Like a social club."

00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:44.864
If we let L win the bid
for this upcoming project…

00:14:44.947 --> 00:14:46.991
-"Win bid."
-…we'll take the next Ministry deal.

00:14:47.074 --> 00:14:48.409
"We'll take it."

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.037
Then we'll let T have the next deal.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.788
"T will have the next deal."

00:14:52.872 --> 00:14:54.373
That's so distracting.

00:14:55.458 --> 00:14:57.084
Just say it in your head.

00:14:58.294 --> 00:14:59.170
I'm sorry, sir.

00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:01.756
It's a very important meeting.

00:15:02.381 --> 00:15:03.674
Which one of you will…

00:15:05.092 --> 00:15:07.929
I'll oversee everything, Mr. Baek.

00:15:12.808 --> 00:15:14.352
-Jin-woo, you can…
-Yes, sir.

00:15:15.061 --> 00:15:16.521
If you'll excuse me.

00:15:16.604 --> 00:15:18.898
-Sure.
-Bye.

00:15:21.984 --> 00:15:23.110
My gosh.

00:15:25.112 --> 00:15:26.989
What was that all about? Let me handle it.

00:15:27.073 --> 00:15:28.991
You two should do it together.
It's a big job.

00:15:29.075 --> 00:15:31.953
How can I work with a guy who drags
his slippers into the boss's office?

00:15:32.036 --> 00:15:34.163
-I can handle--
-Do you enter this room

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.624
when I'm not here?

00:15:39.001 --> 00:15:42.421
I only came to check if you were in early

00:15:42.505 --> 00:15:44.465
and to say hello.

00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:46.050
-Nak-su.
-Yes.

00:15:46.133 --> 00:15:49.095
Honestly, I'd rather
have my guy get promoted

00:15:49.178 --> 00:15:51.305
to managing director over Do Jin-woo.

00:15:52.056 --> 00:15:53.307
I mean it.

00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:54.350
Yes.

00:15:54.433 --> 00:15:57.270
Keep yourself in check.
There are eyes on you everywhere.

00:15:58.271 --> 00:16:00.481
Do Jin-woo didn't mean to rat you out.

00:16:00.565 --> 00:16:02.149
He's looking out for you.

00:16:03.943 --> 00:16:07.446
That's not what…
I had something to tell you this morning--

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.366
Just say sorry and be done with it,
for Christ's sake.

00:16:10.908 --> 00:16:11.784
Okay?

00:16:12.326 --> 00:16:13.995
I'm sorry.

00:16:15.788 --> 00:16:18.791
And how come your team members
arrive to work at the same time as me?

00:16:18.874 --> 00:16:21.210
Jin-woo's team is always ready to go.

00:16:21.836 --> 00:16:25.089
Your people always
just barely make it by 9:00.

00:16:25.172 --> 00:16:27.049
I'll have a talk with them.

00:16:27.133 --> 00:16:28.759
"Punctuality."

00:16:30.219 --> 00:16:32.305
And pick me up for golf on Saturday.

00:16:32.388 --> 00:16:33.639
"Pick up on Saturday."

00:16:35.516 --> 00:16:37.310
You know my new address, right?

00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:40.062
Yes, of course. Banpo River Palace.

00:16:40.146 --> 00:16:41.188
It's Building 103.

00:16:41.272 --> 00:16:44.275
-"Building 103."
-For heaven's sake.

00:16:45.526 --> 00:16:47.361
I keep forgetting things these days.

00:16:49.447 --> 00:16:51.616
Pick Jin-woo up on your way to my house.

00:16:52.158 --> 00:16:54.493
You want me to pick Jin-woo up?

00:16:54.577 --> 00:16:56.579
It's better than moving around
in two or three cars.

00:16:56.662 --> 00:16:58.122
After all, we'll be drinking.

00:16:59.624 --> 00:17:02.668
What now? You don't feel
like giving your junior a ride?

00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:06.922
Not at all. I'll do that.

00:17:11.802 --> 00:17:12.887
Mr. Kim.

00:17:14.847 --> 00:17:16.932
Tattle-tale, tattle-tale, tattling again!

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.601
Pardon? What was that?

00:17:18.684 --> 00:17:20.144
Nothing.

00:17:21.729 --> 00:17:24.649
Mr. Baek told me
to pick you up this Saturday.

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:27.485
I was just told that too, sir.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:31.072
-I'm sorry.
-Nothing to feel sorry about.

00:17:31.656 --> 00:17:34.533
I can just wake up
a little earlier, right?

00:17:35.117 --> 00:17:38.579
You'll be too tired. Let me drive.

00:17:40.748 --> 00:17:41.999
Don't bother.

00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:44.835
My car is bigger. I'll drive.

00:17:44.919 --> 00:17:47.338
Okay then.

00:17:47.963 --> 00:17:49.548
With so many eyes watching that day,

00:17:49.632 --> 00:17:52.885
it would be a lot better to take
your nice car rather than mine.

00:17:52.968 --> 00:17:55.304
It's not all about the size, though.

00:17:56.722 --> 00:17:58.182
He sure is young.

00:17:59.684 --> 00:18:00.685
What a beast.

00:18:02.144 --> 00:18:03.562
Look at it go.

00:18:04.188 --> 00:18:07.274
This isn't a robot.

00:18:07.358 --> 00:18:09.694
It's more like the boss.

00:18:09.777 --> 00:18:10.695
Hey!

00:18:10.778 --> 00:18:12.988
This is what I get for listening to you!

00:18:13.072 --> 00:18:15.950
Ha-jin, Robot Auntie didn't do
anything wrong.

00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:17.618
The problem is your old house.

00:18:17.702 --> 00:18:19.203
It works just fine for us, doesn't it?

00:18:19.286 --> 00:18:21.226
-Is she on vacation?
-Ha-jin.

00:18:21.326 --> 00:18:24.083
Get a contractor
and have the threshold removed.

00:18:24.166 --> 00:18:26.711
That will make the house
look bigger and everything.

00:18:26.794 --> 00:18:28.796
If that's all, I'm going.
I've got breakfast waiting.

00:18:28.879 --> 00:18:31.674
-Wait! Hold on!
-See you next time, Ha-jin.

00:18:31.757 --> 00:18:32.717
HA-YEONG
CALL ENDED

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.884
That brat.

00:18:39.348 --> 00:18:41.642
What do I do with you?

00:18:43.227 --> 00:18:45.312
Both of us are so pathetic.

00:18:48.107 --> 00:18:49.608
Right.

00:18:58.159 --> 00:18:59.660
ACT STUDENT MARKETER PROGRAM
APPLY NOW

00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:02.747
I'm not doing this.

00:19:09.628 --> 00:19:12.381
You guys go ahead. See you later. Bye.

00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:19.847
Kim Su-gyeom?

00:19:21.098 --> 00:19:22.099
Sorry?

00:19:24.143 --> 00:19:27.062
Aren't you Kim Su-gyeom
from Gangdong Middle School?

00:19:27.688 --> 00:19:28.647
Who are you?

00:19:29.565 --> 00:19:30.441
Hey.

00:19:31.942 --> 00:19:33.319
I'm Lee Han-na.

00:19:33.402 --> 00:19:34.320
What?

00:19:34.403 --> 00:19:35.738
I'm Lee Han-na.

00:19:37.615 --> 00:19:38.908
Han-na?

00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:41.619
Don't you remember me?

00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:49.210
Lee Han-na?

00:19:49.835 --> 00:19:50.961
Yes!

00:19:52.254 --> 00:19:55.883
Didn't you go study abroad
after finishing middle school?

00:19:56.509 --> 00:19:59.094
That's right. So you do remember me.

00:19:59.178 --> 00:20:01.055
I'm a freshman
at Michigan State University.

00:20:03.682 --> 00:20:05.100
It's been so long.

00:20:05.601 --> 00:20:07.853
-What are you doing here?
-I'm here as an exchange student.

00:20:07.937 --> 00:20:09.730
I see.

00:20:09.814 --> 00:20:11.690
Well, I'm sort of here on a half-vacation.

00:20:15.694 --> 00:20:17.238
It's been so long.

00:20:19.156 --> 00:20:20.324
Han-na!

00:20:20.407 --> 00:20:21.534
Okay.

00:20:22.284 --> 00:20:23.828
Are you free tomorrow evening?

00:20:23.911 --> 00:20:25.538
Tomorrow evening? Why?

00:20:25.621 --> 00:20:27.498
Just tell me if you're free or not.

00:20:28.624 --> 00:20:30.793
-I am.
-Do you have a pen?

00:20:45.099 --> 00:20:46.809
MIYUM ART MUSEUM
7 P.M.

00:20:49.311 --> 00:20:50.354
Here.

00:20:51.105 --> 00:20:52.273
I'll see you there tomorrow.

00:20:53.148 --> 00:20:54.233
Bye.

00:21:00.573 --> 00:21:01.574
Let's go.

00:21:08.581 --> 00:21:09.707
So how much do we need?

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.750
CURRENT EXPENSE X 0.7
= MONTHLY RETIREMENT EXPENSE

00:21:11.834 --> 00:21:14.587
Transportation costs.
About 100,000 won, right?

00:21:15.337 --> 00:21:17.464
-Phone bills. You need your phones.
-Yes.

00:21:17.548 --> 00:21:20.593
Insurance fees.
And your taxes and utility fees.

00:21:21.552 --> 00:21:23.554
Are you done with your calculations?

00:21:23.637 --> 00:21:25.347
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:21:25.431 --> 00:21:26.765
Then you need to add

00:21:26.849 --> 00:21:28.976
-one more thing to that pile.
-What?

00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:31.478
-No.
-What do you mean, "No"?

00:21:31.562 --> 00:21:33.397
We haven't calculated
our medical expenses yet.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.356
MEDICAL EXPENSES!

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.191
-Right.
-Not clothes,

00:21:36.275 --> 00:21:37.776
-but medical expenses.
-They cost a lot.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.321
We can't live for 50 years
without ever getting sick.

00:21:40.404 --> 00:21:41.780
-Right?
-That's right.

00:21:41.864 --> 00:21:43.616
Write it down. Medical expenses.

00:21:43.699 --> 00:21:44.575
MEDICAL EXPENSES

00:21:44.658 --> 00:21:45.701
In the year 2033,

00:21:46.201 --> 00:21:48.871
if Mr. Kim, a 51-year-old general manager
at a major company in Seoul,

00:21:48.954 --> 00:21:51.749
were to live to 100,
fortunately or unfortunately,

00:21:51.832 --> 00:21:54.668
how much would his family of three need?

00:21:54.752 --> 00:21:55.836
650 million won.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.380
We have 650 million. Anyone else?

00:21:58.464 --> 00:21:59.632
I say 730 million won.

00:21:59.715 --> 00:22:01.800
-Okay, 730 million won.
-Maybe 800.

00:22:01.884 --> 00:22:03.719
Eight hundred?
Do we really need that much?

00:22:05.304 --> 00:22:06.430
On average,

00:22:07.306 --> 00:22:08.349
you need 1.28 billion won.

00:22:08.432 --> 00:22:10.225
-What?
-You need 1.28 billion won?

00:22:10.309 --> 00:22:12.478
-1.28 billion won.
-That much?

00:22:13.103 --> 00:22:14.521
That's a lot, isn't it?

00:22:14.605 --> 00:22:15.564
TOTAL

00:22:15.648 --> 00:22:17.942
What do you think?
This is our best-selling model right now.

00:22:19.485 --> 00:22:22.571
I'd like a bag priced
between 2.5 and 3 million won.

00:22:22.655 --> 00:22:24.573
What kind of design are you looking for?

00:22:24.657 --> 00:22:26.784
Any men's briefcase will do. In black.

00:22:26.867 --> 00:22:30.746
But in the 2.5 to 3 million won range.

00:22:30.829 --> 00:22:32.456
I understand. One moment, please.

00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:33.457
Okay.

00:22:36.627 --> 00:22:38.003
Sir.

00:22:38.087 --> 00:22:39.838
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

00:22:43.968 --> 00:22:46.178
SALES SUPPORT TEAM
HEO TAE-HWAN (EMPLOYED 25 YEARS)

00:22:46.261 --> 00:22:48.138
Can't you just get it repaired?

00:22:48.222 --> 00:22:49.598
The warranty period is over.

00:22:49.682 --> 00:22:51.308
Then get it repaired somewhere.

00:22:51.392 --> 00:22:53.727
Knock it off.
It's about time I get a new bag.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.021
Then let me have it.

00:22:56.105 --> 00:22:58.023
No way! Give it to me.

00:23:00.484 --> 00:23:03.070
Are you sure about this?
Won't Ha-jin say something?

00:23:03.153 --> 00:23:05.823
I'm spending the money I earned.
No one can say anything about that.

00:23:05.906 --> 00:23:06.907
Gosh.

00:23:07.449 --> 00:23:09.118
I guess you still have a say at home.

00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:11.829
Not just "still."
It will stay like that for good.

00:23:12.579 --> 00:23:14.123
What did you want to tell me?

00:23:16.583 --> 00:23:17.626
Let's talk at a cafe.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.129
What is it with people and cafes?

00:23:20.212 --> 00:23:23.298
The staff lounge is stocked
with instant coffee mix and capsules.

00:23:23.382 --> 00:23:24.800
Let's just talk here. What is it?

00:23:28.846 --> 00:23:30.180
I'm going to Ulleungdo Island.

00:23:31.682 --> 00:23:32.850
On a trip?

00:23:33.392 --> 00:23:34.727
Why are you going so far?

00:23:37.229 --> 00:23:38.439
They told me to go.

00:23:38.981 --> 00:23:41.358
They told me to go manage the facilities.

00:23:42.568 --> 00:23:43.694
I've got a month left.

00:23:52.411 --> 00:23:54.246
Jeez, man.

00:23:55.831 --> 00:23:57.332
What am I going to do?

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.420
Sir, I've got the briefcase.

00:24:01.503 --> 00:24:02.379
Okay.

00:24:07.968 --> 00:24:09.094
It's 2.6 million won,

00:24:09.178 --> 00:24:11.638
and it's made of calf leather.

00:24:13.724 --> 00:24:15.434
This should be good enough.

00:24:15.517 --> 00:24:16.977
Shall I hand it over then?

00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:18.854
Mr. Kim told us to handle it ourselves.

00:24:18.937 --> 00:24:21.106
Did he? That's done then. I'll send it.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.608
I'm not sure.

00:24:23.859 --> 00:24:24.943
I need to leave soon.

00:24:26.278 --> 00:24:28.030
There he is. Hello, Mr. Kim.

00:24:28.113 --> 00:24:29.656
Did you enjoy your lunch?

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:30.949
-Yes.
-Here.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.576
For you.

00:24:33.994 --> 00:24:34.870
Mr. Kim.

00:24:34.953 --> 00:24:35.829
I'm going to send

00:24:35.913 --> 00:24:38.916
the Q2 and Q4 public institution
new business strategy presentation.

00:24:38.999 --> 00:24:40.918
I told you to handle it with Ik-hyeon.

00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:42.503
Can I really send it over?

00:24:43.629 --> 00:24:45.672
Please handle it on your own.

00:24:45.756 --> 00:24:47.758
Have a sense of ownership, will you?

00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:50.344
Mr. Kim,

00:24:50.427 --> 00:24:53.013
this is the very final version,
and it'll be difficult to revise it.

00:24:53.097 --> 00:24:55.933
The Managing Director and
the Executive Director will see it.

00:24:59.103 --> 00:25:00.479
Hey. Add a space.

00:25:00.562 --> 00:25:02.189
-Okay. A space?
-No, change a line.

00:25:02.272 --> 00:25:04.983
-An arrow.
-An arrow.

00:25:05.067 --> 00:25:06.401
From the top menu, under "Shapes."

00:25:06.485 --> 00:25:07.945
-Keep looking.
-Yes, sir.

00:25:08.028 --> 00:25:09.279
What's with this font?

00:25:09.363 --> 00:25:11.949
It stands out too much. Change it.

00:25:12.032 --> 00:25:13.909
-Okay.
-Not that one.

00:25:13.992 --> 00:25:15.452
Not that one.

00:25:15.536 --> 00:25:17.329
You must be busy. Why don't we handle--

00:25:17.412 --> 00:25:20.249
If you were good at your jobs,
I wouldn't be busy. What's with the red?

00:25:20.332 --> 00:25:21.375
It's just red.

00:25:22.376 --> 00:25:25.337
It's not the red we usually use.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.714
I think it is.

00:25:27.798 --> 00:25:28.924
Is it?

00:25:32.219 --> 00:25:33.095
Take a look.

00:25:33.762 --> 00:25:36.306
Do they look the same to you?

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:37.516
Look.

00:25:38.058 --> 00:25:40.894
I think it looks a little different
because it's printed out.

00:25:43.981 --> 00:25:45.649
What if they're actually different?

00:25:45.732 --> 00:25:47.192
It's fixed. Shall I send it?

00:25:47.276 --> 00:25:48.318
-Wait.
-Okay.

00:25:48.402 --> 00:25:50.362
What if they're actually different?

00:25:50.445 --> 00:25:51.530
Here.

00:25:51.613 --> 00:25:54.241
Is this red the same as that red?

00:25:54.324 --> 00:25:55.200
Huh? The same?

00:25:55.284 --> 00:25:56.493
But I was thinking,

00:25:56.577 --> 00:25:58.579
maybe we could tone down

00:25:58.662 --> 00:26:01.790
-the red a little--
-Just say sorry and be done with it.

00:26:01.874 --> 00:26:03.834
What's with all the excuses?

00:26:03.917 --> 00:26:04.835
I'm sorry.

00:26:04.918 --> 00:26:06.378
-Sung-gu.
-Yes, sir.

00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:07.796
Train your junior right.

00:26:09.214 --> 00:26:10.465
I'm sorry.

00:26:12.718 --> 00:26:16.096
Team performance is judged
on details like this.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.850
Performance reviews are around the corner.
Stay on your toes, will you?

00:26:19.933 --> 00:26:21.894
-Mr. Kim.
-What?

00:26:23.312 --> 00:26:25.063
I have a half day, so I'll get going.

00:26:27.399 --> 00:26:29.943
Great timing. What are you talking about?

00:26:30.027 --> 00:26:31.278
I told you a week ago.

00:26:31.361 --> 00:26:32.905
When was that?

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.032
It should be on your messenger app.

00:26:37.326 --> 00:26:38.493
Okay. Just go.

00:26:40.287 --> 00:26:41.580
See you tomorrow.

00:26:42.956 --> 00:26:45.417
-What are you doing? Found it?
-Yes, sir.

00:26:50.422 --> 00:26:52.633
Leaving his working colleagues…
Zero loyalty.

00:26:53.383 --> 00:26:56.220
Mr. Song already finished
his work yesterday.

00:27:00.057 --> 00:27:01.516
"Mr. Song"?

00:27:02.684 --> 00:27:05.062
Ik-hyeon definitely lacks loyalty.

00:27:05.145 --> 00:27:06.396
Right.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.690
Where on earth does he keep going to?

00:27:08.774 --> 00:27:10.734
He said he was going for some inspections.

00:27:10.817 --> 00:27:11.902
Infection? Is he sick?

00:27:15.239 --> 00:27:16.448
No, inspections.

00:27:17.199 --> 00:27:19.785
He's going to analyze
real estate properties on-site.

00:27:19.868 --> 00:27:21.119
Real estate?

00:27:21.203 --> 00:27:22.412
Yes.

00:27:22.496 --> 00:27:24.206
He does that during work hours?

00:27:30.003 --> 00:27:32.756
Doesn't he know there's
a real estate master right here?

00:27:33.382 --> 00:27:35.592
Look at the stock market these days.

00:27:35.676 --> 00:27:37.803
The blue chips are rocketing
through the roof,

00:27:37.886 --> 00:27:40.597
while the junk stocks
are crashing to the bottom.

00:27:40.681 --> 00:27:43.308
The gap between them
just keeps getting wider.

00:27:43.392 --> 00:27:44.559
Polarization.

00:27:44.643 --> 00:27:46.645
The same goes for housing prices.

00:27:46.728 --> 00:27:49.856
The saying "real estate never loses"
is a thing of the past.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.608
One smart property is all you need.

00:27:51.692 --> 00:27:52.901
One smart property.

00:27:52.985 --> 00:27:54.695
Okay. Sure.

00:27:55.988 --> 00:27:59.491
Come here, Su-gyeom,
my one and only smart son.

00:27:59.574 --> 00:28:02.661
Now that you're in college,
you should know stuff like this.

00:28:02.744 --> 00:28:04.538
Economics. Personal finance.

00:28:04.621 --> 00:28:07.332
Men must know things like this.

00:28:10.085 --> 00:28:13.171
You've been doing that for a while.
Just what are you doing?

00:28:13.255 --> 00:28:18.343
I'm making a door ramp for Robot Auntie.

00:28:18.427 --> 00:28:19.553
What's wrong with your mom?

00:28:19.636 --> 00:28:22.014
How much did you say you paid for it?

00:28:22.097 --> 00:28:23.974
It was 800,000 won.

00:28:24.057 --> 00:28:24.933
Eight hundred…

00:28:26.852 --> 00:28:30.188
I'm worried your mom has
some kind of shopping addiction.

00:28:30.272 --> 00:28:33.025
What's the point of me making money
if we don't save it?

00:28:34.401 --> 00:28:35.485
Gosh.

00:28:36.987 --> 00:28:38.989
What is it?

00:28:39.781 --> 00:28:41.867
Right.

00:28:42.576 --> 00:28:44.870
What was I going to say?

00:28:45.912 --> 00:28:47.831
-A smart--
-A smart property.

00:28:47.914 --> 00:28:49.916
Oh, right!

00:28:50.417 --> 00:28:54.338
We had no choice but to rent
before I became a general manager.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.424
Look at how much
this apartment's value has gone up.

00:28:57.507 --> 00:29:00.969
If we hadn't bought it back then,
we would've never been able to afford it.

00:29:01.053 --> 00:29:02.804
You did an excellent job, Dad.

00:29:02.888 --> 00:29:06.141
You remember what I said
when we were buying this apartment, right?

00:29:06.224 --> 00:29:07.684
When we were buying this apartment?

00:29:07.768 --> 00:29:08.769
Yes.

00:29:12.314 --> 00:29:14.941
You really want to buy this apartment?
Don't you watch the news?

00:29:15.025 --> 00:29:18.070
It's better to buy it
than to keep paying higher deposits.

00:29:18.153 --> 00:29:21.406
People say the cost of mid-tier places
in Seoul goes up as much as inflation.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:22.741
I've looked into it.

00:29:22.824 --> 00:29:25.535
They're all just saying
whatever they were paid to say.

00:29:25.619 --> 00:29:26.745
Do you buy what they say?

00:29:26.828 --> 00:29:29.915
How would they know if prices
will keep going up or not? Are they gods?

00:29:29.998 --> 00:29:32.084
Will they take responsibility
if the bubble bursts?

00:29:32.167 --> 00:29:34.628
Forget it. If you don't help me,

00:29:34.711 --> 00:29:37.089
I'll ask my parents for a loan
and buy the apartment.

00:29:37.172 --> 00:29:40.008
Goodness, do you hear yourself?
Are you out of your mind?

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.185
I'm going to do it.

00:30:08.495 --> 00:30:10.539
It doesn't matter whose idea it was.

00:30:10.622 --> 00:30:14.835
In the end, it's your apartment,
bought with the money you earned.

00:30:15.502 --> 00:30:16.962
Well said.

00:30:18.046 --> 00:30:19.423
Yes, it's all thanks to you.

00:30:20.048 --> 00:30:22.092
-You're the best.
-You're the best, Dad.

00:30:22.175 --> 00:30:24.636
Our family is the best.

00:30:26.888 --> 00:30:28.932
MIYUM ART MUSEUM
7 P.M.

00:30:33.061 --> 00:30:36.565
Will you go up now, Robot Auntie?

00:30:36.648 --> 00:30:37.899
-Let's see.
-Enjoy, Dad.

00:30:37.983 --> 00:30:40.986
Let me see.

00:30:47.367 --> 00:30:49.035
They were being sarcastic, right?

00:30:53.874 --> 00:30:55.208
-Mr. Heo Tae-hwan?
-Yes!

00:30:55.292 --> 00:30:56.585
Come quickly.

00:30:56.668 --> 00:30:59.588
You didn't even tell me what's going on.
What's the rush?

00:30:59.671 --> 00:31:01.089
-Go over there.
-There?

00:31:01.173 --> 00:31:02.799
-You'll see.
-Okay.

00:31:02.883 --> 00:31:04.634
-Mr. Lee. Mr. Heo Tae-hwan?
-Sorry!

00:31:04.718 --> 00:31:06.386
I'm sorry. My apologies.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:07.888
I didn't know it was here.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.681
Give that to him.

00:31:09.764 --> 00:31:12.476
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:31:12.976 --> 00:31:14.728
Let's begin the job training

00:31:14.811 --> 00:31:18.607
for your transfers
in the second half of the year.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.609
-Mr. Heo Tae-hwan.
-Yes.

00:31:20.692 --> 00:31:23.195
Demonstrate
the confined space entry procedure.

00:31:23.695 --> 00:31:24.696
Sorry?

00:31:25.989 --> 00:31:27.032
Climb down.

00:31:28.158 --> 00:31:29.159
Down there?

00:31:29.826 --> 00:31:31.870
Aren't you working in Ulleungdo
starting next month?

00:31:31.953 --> 00:31:35.165
Yes, I am. But I've never done
anything like that before.

00:31:35.248 --> 00:31:36.333
In Ulleungdo,

00:31:36.416 --> 00:31:39.002
78% of the cable sections are underground.

00:31:39.085 --> 00:31:42.297
You need to know how to go in
and perform a basic inspection.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.591
If islanders lose communication
in an emergency,

00:31:44.674 --> 00:31:46.551
will you take responsibility?

00:31:47.177 --> 00:31:48.178
Climb down.

00:31:51.431 --> 00:31:55.727
RESTRICTED AREA

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:00.190
That's why I said to wear sneakers.

00:32:00.732 --> 00:32:02.317
Everyone else did. Didn't you tell him?

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.693
I did.

00:32:12.827 --> 00:32:14.204
It's been five minutes. Hurry.

00:32:14.287 --> 00:32:15.372
Okay!

00:32:16.831 --> 00:32:17.999
Next person, get ready.

00:32:46.278 --> 00:32:47.988
Hello, Mr. Kim!

00:32:49.197 --> 00:32:50.073
Hello.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.162
It's a used car.

00:32:56.246 --> 00:32:57.998
But it's covered in plastic.

00:32:58.081 --> 00:32:59.958
That's because

00:33:00.917 --> 00:33:04.296
I bought some and put it on,
so it could feel like a new car.

00:33:04.879 --> 00:33:06.464
Do people really do that?

00:33:06.548 --> 00:33:08.425
Your car is fully decked out.

00:33:08.508 --> 00:33:10.135
Mine is just a clunker.

00:33:10.218 --> 00:33:12.262
Even Mr. Baek drives a domestic sedan.

00:33:12.345 --> 00:33:16.766
You won't have to change cars
until you make it to executive.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:19.144
Sir, please don't tease me.

00:33:19.978 --> 00:33:22.063
-How much was it?
-It was…

00:33:22.606 --> 00:33:24.399
That's Mr. Song's car.

00:33:25.025 --> 00:33:26.067
-Mr. Song.
-Ik-hyeon.

00:33:31.114 --> 00:33:33.408
-Ik-hyeon!
-Hello, Mr. Kim.

00:33:34.326 --> 00:33:36.995
Sung-gu. You finally bought it, huh?

00:33:38.204 --> 00:33:42.208
You've kept your car in great shape.

00:33:42.292 --> 00:33:44.628
So modest, so frugal,
and so pleasing to the eye.

00:33:44.711 --> 00:33:46.254
Yes.

00:33:46.338 --> 00:33:48.214
That car's just for commuting.

00:33:49.966 --> 00:33:51.635
Shall we head up now?

00:33:51.718 --> 00:33:53.428
We'll get ready for work.

00:33:57.932 --> 00:33:59.059
Ik-hyeon.

00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:02.646
Mr. Kim!

00:34:03.188 --> 00:34:05.148
You finally got a new bag!

00:34:05.231 --> 00:34:07.442
Mine was getting old, so I got a new one.

00:34:07.525 --> 00:34:10.362
It's the hottest designer brand.

00:34:10.445 --> 00:34:11.321
Mr. Do…

00:34:15.325 --> 00:34:16.576
Did you see Do Jin-woo's--

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:18.536
Try again, Sung-gu.

00:34:19.621 --> 00:34:21.915
Did you buy it after seeing Jin-woo's bag?

00:34:22.415 --> 00:34:24.918
No. Does he have one too?

00:34:25.001 --> 00:34:25.877
Yes.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:30.256
-Ik-hyeon.
-Yes, sir.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.925
What do you drive on the weekends?

00:34:41.059 --> 00:34:43.311
Mr. Kim! Goodness. So heavy.

00:34:43.395 --> 00:34:45.105
What's so funny, guys?

00:34:45.188 --> 00:34:47.732
Myung-heon went on a blind date yesterday.

00:34:48.817 --> 00:34:50.026
Go on, tell him.

00:34:50.652 --> 00:34:52.737
-It wasn't bad.
-It sounds like it was.

00:34:52.821 --> 00:34:54.280
It was really bad.

00:34:54.364 --> 00:34:56.199
As a woman, I think it's a lost cause.

00:34:56.282 --> 00:34:57.826
She was nice enough,

00:34:57.909 --> 00:35:00.412
but she wouldn't pay a dime
until the third round.

00:35:02.372 --> 00:35:03.456
And?

00:35:14.592 --> 00:35:17.095
That's the one the clerk
recommended yesterday.

00:35:17.178 --> 00:35:19.597
With the credit card discount,
it comes to 2.3 million…

00:35:19.681 --> 00:35:21.975
It's 2.3 million won.

00:35:22.767 --> 00:35:23.810
I won.

00:35:24.352 --> 00:35:26.229
-I won!
-Is that so?

00:35:30.817 --> 00:35:32.110
Cheer up.

00:35:32.193 --> 00:35:33.278
We can do it!

00:35:34.738 --> 00:35:35.739
We can do it!

00:35:36.448 --> 00:35:38.450
-Drink up!
-Bottoms up!

00:35:38.533 --> 00:35:39.826
-Here.
-Long time no see.

00:35:39.909 --> 00:35:41.035
Go get your hair dyed.

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:43.288
Chip in some money before you say that.

00:35:44.998 --> 00:35:47.292
So, are you making executive
this year or what?

00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:49.878
I've got a rival on the other team,
but he's not a threat.

00:35:49.961 --> 00:35:52.130
No connections,
and just a junior college grad.

00:35:52.213 --> 00:35:54.716
Isn't he on the same sales team as you?

00:35:55.216 --> 00:35:56.468
Why do you ask?

00:35:56.551 --> 00:35:59.846
I think I saw him
on your company's YouTube channel.

00:35:59.929 --> 00:36:01.222
-Hang on.
-What is it?

00:36:01.306 --> 00:36:02.348
I'm Do Jin-woo,

00:36:02.432 --> 00:36:03.892
-general manager…
-Watch.

00:36:03.975 --> 00:36:06.311
-It's him, right?
-… of Sales Team 2 at ACT.

00:36:06.394 --> 00:36:08.271
-Mr. Do! Hang on.
-That punk.

00:36:08.354 --> 00:36:10.231
-It's him.
-You're a general manager?

00:36:10.315 --> 00:36:12.484
Why would you look up a video like this?

00:36:12.567 --> 00:36:15.153
We watch stuff like this all day at PR.

00:36:15.236 --> 00:36:16.488
How old is he?

00:36:16.571 --> 00:36:17.947
He looks young.

00:36:18.031 --> 00:36:20.200
-I don't know.
-To be a general manager at his age,

00:36:20.283 --> 00:36:22.160
he must've had fast-track promotions.

00:36:22.243 --> 00:36:23.995
Did they ask you
to film something like this?

00:36:24.078 --> 00:36:25.413
Whatever.

00:36:25.497 --> 00:36:27.791
They didn't, did they?

00:36:27.874 --> 00:36:29.167
They didn't.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.877
If I were the boss,

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.837
I'd make him the managing director. Look.

00:36:32.921 --> 00:36:35.298
-Get that out of my face.
-Stay still.

00:36:35.381 --> 00:36:38.426
You see, these days, even executives
have to be young and good-looking.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:41.095
How does putting up an old man like you
help the company's image?

00:36:41.179 --> 00:36:43.014
Get it out of my face!

00:36:43.097 --> 00:36:44.724
Shouldn't you start

00:36:44.808 --> 00:36:46.351
going to startup fairs like me?

00:36:46.434 --> 00:36:47.852
Don't talk crap.

00:36:47.936 --> 00:36:50.480
Say what you will,
but I'm the number one choice.

00:36:50.563 --> 00:36:52.023
He went to a junior college.

00:36:52.106 --> 00:36:55.318
You moron.
Can't you see the bigger picture?

00:36:55.401 --> 00:36:57.111
Once you've made it to general manager,

00:36:57.195 --> 00:37:00.990
a junior college degree
isn't a handicap. It's a weapon.

00:37:01.074 --> 00:37:03.827
It's a testament to 100% pure skill.

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.830
Isn't your company always
talking about ESG management?

00:37:06.913 --> 00:37:09.415
An executive in his forties
from a junior college

00:37:10.083 --> 00:37:12.627
would be perfect for refreshing
the company's image.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.587
-That's so true.
-The usual for me!

00:37:14.671 --> 00:37:15.922
All right.

00:37:16.005 --> 00:37:18.216
-Here!
-Sorry, I'm late!

00:37:18.299 --> 00:37:19.843
-Gosh.
-I'm so sorry!

00:37:19.926 --> 00:37:22.345
How is the jobless one
always the last to arrive?

00:37:22.428 --> 00:37:23.388
My apologies! Sorry!

00:37:23.471 --> 00:37:26.099
A tenant suddenly decided to move out,
so I'm all over the place.

00:37:26.182 --> 00:37:28.268
-The third floor?
-They had the whole floor.

00:37:28.351 --> 00:37:29.519
Was it the cram school?

00:37:29.602 --> 00:37:32.939
Yes. I thought they'd stay for a while.

00:37:33.022 --> 00:37:35.066
It's hard to rent out
the third and fourth floors.

00:37:35.149 --> 00:37:37.193
-That's right.
-What are you talking about?

00:37:37.277 --> 00:37:39.904
-It's about the building.
-What building?

00:37:40.947 --> 00:37:42.282
I told you.

00:37:42.365 --> 00:37:44.784
I bought an eight-story building
at the end of last year.

00:37:44.868 --> 00:37:46.077
Who did?

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.078
I did!

00:37:48.663 --> 00:37:50.707
-What?
-They call me a landlord.

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.667
But I'm basically their call center.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.168
The moment something goes wrong,

00:37:54.252 --> 00:37:56.713
they call me night and day.

00:37:57.714 --> 00:37:58.965
I'm so over it.

00:37:59.465 --> 00:38:00.925
Have some food.

00:38:01.009 --> 00:38:02.135
You bought a building?

00:38:03.136 --> 00:38:04.137
You punk.

00:38:04.637 --> 00:38:06.556
You don't read the group chat, do you?

00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:09.100
Didn't you know?
He only reads it when it's about him.

00:38:09.183 --> 00:38:11.060
-Come on.
-You all knew about this?

00:38:11.144 --> 00:38:12.061
Jeez.

00:38:12.729 --> 00:38:15.398
-The usual.
-Thank you.

00:38:18.943 --> 00:38:21.404
-How much is the rent?
-I get around 30 million won.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.117
I didn't mean the yearly rent, stupid.
This isn't Jeju Island.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.995
I know! I meant the monthly rent!

00:38:29.078 --> 00:38:30.747
I get 30 million won per month.

00:38:32.957 --> 00:38:35.251
Hey, this one's good.

00:38:35.335 --> 00:38:38.588
30 MILLION WON PER MONTH

00:38:41.299 --> 00:38:42.508
I'm so damn jealous.

00:38:44.135 --> 00:38:46.054
Don't be jealous, Nak-su.

00:38:46.137 --> 00:38:47.972
Half of it ends up in taxes.

00:38:48.056 --> 00:38:50.558
I pay three million won
just for health insurance.

00:38:51.517 --> 00:38:54.729
Once you make executive next year,
that'll all be chump change for you.

00:38:54.812 --> 00:38:56.898
You'll become one next year, right?

00:39:00.276 --> 00:39:02.320
-What's so funny?
-Will he not?

00:39:02.403 --> 00:39:03.363
It's nothing.

00:39:05.137 --> 00:39:06.282
Come on. Bottoms up.

00:39:06.574 --> 00:39:07.450
TAE-HWAN

00:39:07.533 --> 00:39:08.701
It's good.

00:39:08.785 --> 00:39:09.702
No.

00:39:09.786 --> 00:39:12.163
-Stop pouring.
-I'm drinking too.

00:39:16.417 --> 00:39:18.920
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

00:39:19.003 --> 00:39:19.963
Please leave a message…

00:39:20.046 --> 00:39:21.214
NAK-SU

00:39:34.519 --> 00:39:36.688
BEYOND TELECOMMUNICATION
CONNECTING PEOPLE

00:39:36.771 --> 00:39:37.897
WE CONNECT THE FUTURE

00:40:33.161 --> 00:40:34.454
JEALOUSY, MY STRENGTH

00:40:51.512 --> 00:40:54.682
Hello, I'm Lee Jeong-hwan,
the CEO of Jealousy, My Strength.

00:40:59.812 --> 00:41:02.899
The journey to this moment
has been full of hardships,

00:41:02.982 --> 00:41:05.610
and I'm deeply grateful
to the many people who stood by me

00:41:05.693 --> 00:41:07.612
and helped me overcome them.

00:41:07.695 --> 00:41:11.574
I'd especially like to thank
those who decided to invest in us.

00:41:11.657 --> 00:41:13.242
This is more than just funding.

00:41:13.326 --> 00:41:16.996
It's an acknowledgment of the vision
of Jealousy, My Strength.

00:41:22.251 --> 00:41:23.711
I've been looking for you.

00:41:23.795 --> 00:41:25.963
Answer your phone, will you?

00:41:26.047 --> 00:41:27.799
-We'll talk details later.
-Okay.

00:41:27.882 --> 00:41:29.425
-The night is young.
-Sorry.

00:41:42.605 --> 00:41:45.149
-Jeong-hwan! Over here!
-Hi.

00:41:48.945 --> 00:41:50.029
How did I do?

00:41:50.113 --> 00:41:51.489
You did great.

00:41:51.572 --> 00:41:53.449
Let's finish our conversation.

00:41:57.703 --> 00:42:00.706
A clothing company makes clothes.
A film company makes films.

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:02.333
Those days are now over.

00:42:02.416 --> 00:42:04.252
The brand itself.

00:42:04.335 --> 00:42:06.254
Setting up a solid brand.

00:42:06.337 --> 00:42:08.214
That's where I'm going to start.

00:42:08.297 --> 00:42:10.758
A loyal customer base
will naturally follow.

00:42:10.842 --> 00:42:13.469
People who would gladly open their wallets

00:42:13.553 --> 00:42:16.597
even if we were to make
fire extinguishers or gas masks.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.975
Can I ask a question?

00:42:21.477 --> 00:42:23.229
Can you tell me your name first?

00:42:23.312 --> 00:42:24.397
Kim Su-gyeom.

00:42:30.361 --> 00:42:33.531
So at the end of the day,
what kind of company is this?

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.116
What?

00:42:36.075 --> 00:42:37.994
He just explained it.

00:42:39.453 --> 00:42:43.583
Even after all that,
I still don't quite follow.

00:42:44.458 --> 00:42:46.586
Are you saying
you'll actually make gas masks?

00:42:46.669 --> 00:42:49.922
What exactly is it that you'll do?
How are you going to make money?

00:42:50.006 --> 00:42:51.924
Was it

00:42:52.675 --> 00:42:55.011
some kind of metaphor? Gas masks?

00:42:55.094 --> 00:42:56.846
Am I missing something here?

00:43:10.735 --> 00:43:12.945
I'm asking because I want to see
if my gut's right.

00:43:13.029 --> 00:43:14.155
Your parents are…

00:43:14.822 --> 00:43:17.283
that is to say, your mother
is probably a homemaker,

00:43:17.366 --> 00:43:19.118
and your father's an office worker, right?

00:43:19.202 --> 00:43:20.119
Yes.

00:43:20.745 --> 00:43:23.331
Your major is
either business or economics,

00:43:23.414 --> 00:43:25.166
and you're Korean, right?

00:43:25.249 --> 00:43:26.125
Sorry?

00:43:26.209 --> 00:43:28.586
You live in Seoul
in a house owned by your parents.

00:43:28.669 --> 00:43:29.587
Yes.

00:43:30.254 --> 00:43:32.173
Do you live in Gangnam or Seocho?

00:43:33.174 --> 00:43:34.175
No.

00:43:34.258 --> 00:43:36.010
Okay, I was right 100%.

00:43:36.969 --> 00:43:38.512
I knew you'd like him.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.059
You don't act like you're
from Gangnam or Seocho.

00:43:52.485 --> 00:43:54.695
We just met. Why talk down to me?

00:44:04.455 --> 00:44:06.666
100,000 won feels trivial now.

00:44:06.749 --> 00:44:08.084
But in 20, 30 years,

00:44:08.167 --> 00:44:10.878
it could be the difference
between life and death.

00:44:10.962 --> 00:44:13.589
Make sure you save the money and--

00:44:16.425 --> 00:44:17.551
Hello.

00:44:18.511 --> 00:44:20.137
Did you buy a new bag?

00:44:20.221 --> 00:44:21.555
No, it was a gift.

00:44:22.181 --> 00:44:24.892
-Is there anything to snack on?
-You're going to keep drinking?

00:44:24.976 --> 00:44:27.770
Just give me whatever.
Anchovies and beans will do.

00:44:27.853 --> 00:44:30.731
You said Loafer bought something.
Is it making him some money?

00:44:30.815 --> 00:44:32.400
I don't know.

00:44:34.694 --> 00:44:36.570
"Avoid a miserable retirement"?

00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:40.199
It's nothing. It just came up.

00:44:40.283 --> 00:44:42.201
-Park Ha-jin.
-What?

00:44:42.285 --> 00:44:44.287
Don't underestimate your husband.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.539
What do you mean?

00:44:46.622 --> 00:44:48.582
I really am going to become
an executive next year.

00:44:48.666 --> 00:44:51.294
Goodness. Okay, I got it.

00:44:51.377 --> 00:44:53.004
Go get changed.

00:44:53.087 --> 00:44:55.131
What's going on?

00:44:55.214 --> 00:44:57.675
I said I wouldn't make you work.
Why are you watching that?

00:44:57.758 --> 00:44:59.593
Okay, I got it. Go on.

00:44:59.677 --> 00:45:02.179
Goodness, you stink. You should go change.

00:45:11.897 --> 00:45:13.399
That punk.

00:45:16.319 --> 00:45:18.487
My son is home!

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.075
Welcome home, Su-gyeom.

00:45:23.159 --> 00:45:25.119
-I'm home.
-Oh my.

00:45:25.202 --> 00:45:26.412
Su-gyeom, you're home.

00:45:26.495 --> 00:45:27.872
Did you have dinner?

00:45:28.789 --> 00:45:30.541
Come and have a drink with me.

00:45:30.624 --> 00:45:31.917
A drink?

00:45:32.001 --> 00:45:34.086
-Goodness.
-Sit down.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:35.379
Sit.

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:39.175
-You two have a good time.
-Dad, I'm…

00:45:43.095 --> 00:45:44.638
Want to try the CSAT a third time?

00:45:44.722 --> 00:45:45.890
No.

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:52.229
Do you want to study abroad?

00:45:53.647 --> 00:45:55.024
Why are you doing this to me?

00:45:55.107 --> 00:45:56.067
What do you mean?

00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:59.779
Tell me if you want to do it, okay?

00:46:00.988 --> 00:46:03.741
People say academic background
doesn't mean anything.

00:46:03.824 --> 00:46:06.494
But things are different
once you step out into the real world.

00:46:06.577 --> 00:46:07.578
Dad,

00:46:07.661 --> 00:46:10.956
I have class early in the morning.
I'm gonna call it a night.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.542
I need to go to the office early too.

00:46:13.626 --> 00:46:14.960
Sit down.

00:46:15.711 --> 00:46:17.004
Let's talk.

00:46:18.506 --> 00:46:20.716
-Here.
-Okay.

00:46:26.347 --> 00:46:27.223
Son.

00:46:28.641 --> 00:46:32.853
One of my friends is a landlord.

00:46:33.646 --> 00:46:37.858
He owns an eight-story building.
It's huge.

00:46:38.484 --> 00:46:40.486
Do you know how much he makes from rent?

00:46:41.278 --> 00:46:43.614
He gets 30 million won.

00:46:43.697 --> 00:46:44.949
Jeez.

00:46:46.283 --> 00:46:48.786
Goodness gracious. I'm super jealous.

00:46:49.537 --> 00:46:50.454
No.

00:46:51.122 --> 00:46:53.916
You think I'd be jealous of him?

00:46:53.999 --> 00:46:54.917
Not at all.

00:46:55.626 --> 00:46:57.711
I'm not jealous at all.

00:46:58.421 --> 00:46:59.672
Do you know why?

00:46:59.755 --> 00:47:02.133
Because he's still a jobless bum.

00:47:03.843 --> 00:47:06.345
Owning a building means
he's in the rental business.

00:47:06.429 --> 00:47:08.639
-How is he a jobless bum?
-He is.

00:47:08.722 --> 00:47:12.059
He lives on unearned income.
What else could he be?

00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:14.103
Why is that unearned income?

00:47:14.186 --> 00:47:18.190
A landlord has to manage the place,
deal with complaints and whatnot.

00:47:19.108 --> 00:47:22.486
You think people are jealous of landlords
just because they're rich?

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:25.197
People mock them behind their backs.

00:47:25.281 --> 00:47:27.283
You think a guy
dragging his slippers around

00:47:27.366 --> 00:47:29.118
will get any respect from society?

00:47:30.369 --> 00:47:31.996
How would you know that?

00:47:32.872 --> 00:47:33.831
Of course I know!

00:47:33.914 --> 00:47:36.917
I'm over 50. You think I don't know that?

00:47:37.001 --> 00:47:38.002
I know everything.

00:47:42.923 --> 00:47:45.342
The same goes for my older brother.

00:47:45.426 --> 00:47:47.761
He acted all high and mighty,

00:47:47.845 --> 00:47:51.348
but he got left behind
and now runs a car repair shop.

00:47:51.432 --> 00:47:53.017
You saw him last holiday.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.020
All that grease on his face and clothes.

00:47:56.103 --> 00:47:57.897
-Gosh.
-What's wrong with that?

00:47:58.856 --> 00:48:01.692
I'm not saying it's wrong.

00:48:02.693 --> 00:48:05.070
What I want to say

00:48:06.822 --> 00:48:09.074
is that in Korea, after all,

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:13.329
you've got to land a job
at a leading global corporation,

00:48:13.412 --> 00:48:16.081
sit at a desk,

00:48:16.165 --> 00:48:19.376
and type away to make money.

00:48:20.044 --> 00:48:22.129
This is both the standard

00:48:22.838 --> 00:48:26.050
and the most ideal outcome.

00:48:26.133 --> 00:48:27.468
Understood?

00:48:32.181 --> 00:48:34.141
I seem very average to you, don't I?

00:48:36.101 --> 00:48:38.938
But do you have any idea
how hard it is to lead an average life?

00:48:41.357 --> 00:48:44.818
You won't get it
until you step into the real world.

00:48:45.736 --> 00:48:46.654
Do you understand?

00:48:48.447 --> 00:48:49.532
I respect you, Dad.

00:48:49.615 --> 00:48:51.492
I know you've achieved a lot, but--

00:48:57.623 --> 00:48:59.375
You have no idea.

00:49:01.293 --> 00:49:03.963
If you did,
you wouldn't talk to me like that.

00:49:09.218 --> 00:49:10.302
Son.

00:49:11.262 --> 00:49:12.805
-Yes.
-My son.

00:49:12.888 --> 00:49:14.014
Yes.

00:49:15.975 --> 00:49:17.268
Remember this.

00:49:19.228 --> 00:49:22.398
Surviving 25 years at a major corporation
as a general manager,

00:49:24.567 --> 00:49:26.068
buying an apartment in Seoul,

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:29.947
and sending a kid to college…

00:49:31.699 --> 00:49:32.992
That's greatness.

00:49:37.663 --> 00:49:39.123
That's greatness, kiddo.

00:49:56.432 --> 00:49:57.516
Su-gyeom.

00:49:58.017 --> 00:50:01.353
Go to your room. I'll take care of him.
Go get some sleep.

00:50:02.605 --> 00:50:04.064
You've got class tomorrow. Go on.

00:50:09.111 --> 00:50:10.029
Honey.

00:50:11.113 --> 00:50:11.989
Honey.

00:50:12.489 --> 00:50:14.575
Let's get you to the bedroom. Come.

00:50:14.658 --> 00:50:17.202
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

00:50:42.686 --> 00:50:45.397
I just want to be somebody.

00:51:00.204 --> 00:51:03.415
It's a bull market.

00:51:03.499 --> 00:51:04.750
Great.

00:51:08.921 --> 00:51:10.047
"Jin-woo"

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:12.299
GENERAL MANAGER DO JIN-WOO

00:51:12.383 --> 00:51:13.717
"Can I have your address?"

00:51:16.762 --> 00:51:18.222
"I want to pick you up,

00:51:19.264 --> 00:51:20.516
but I need the address."

00:51:21.016 --> 00:51:22.601
This punk.

00:51:22.685 --> 00:51:25.396
He should have sent it already.
So much for seniority.

00:51:30.484 --> 00:51:32.986
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim. I was too busy.

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:34.196
It's Building 201.

00:51:35.739 --> 00:51:36.615
Jeez.

00:51:36.699 --> 00:51:37.574
YOUR FULL ADDRESS

00:51:37.658 --> 00:51:40.786
It's right across from Mr. Baek's place.
It could be confusing.

00:51:42.996 --> 00:51:45.958
You may find it more convenient to type
"Banpo River Palace Building 201"

00:51:46.041 --> 00:51:47.209
into the GPS.

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.173
Good morning.

00:51:53.257 --> 00:51:55.134
I'm on my way.

00:51:55.217 --> 00:51:57.511
Hi, Nak-su. Come to think of it,

00:51:57.594 --> 00:52:00.222
I realized I left my golf bag
in Jin-woo's car.

00:52:00.723 --> 00:52:03.350
I'll just walk to his place.
See you there.

00:52:03.851 --> 00:52:06.854
Okay. I'll be there.

00:52:13.819 --> 00:52:17.614
BANPO BRIDGE
WELCOME TO SEOCHO

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:23.746
"Palace," my foot.

00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:26.290
What are they? Royalty living in a palace?

00:52:40.095 --> 00:52:42.139
Jin-woo is so young, though. Jeez.

00:52:43.265 --> 00:52:44.933
I bet he's on a key money lease.

00:52:45.768 --> 00:52:48.020
Please be on a key money system.

00:52:48.103 --> 00:52:49.605
He has to be.

00:53:01.658 --> 00:53:03.285
How much is the key money lease?

00:53:04.369 --> 00:53:08.749
Key money for River Palace.

00:53:09.958 --> 00:53:11.084
3.8 BILLION
3.7 BILLION

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:14.379
How can it be?

00:53:17.382 --> 00:53:19.384
Can you open the trunk, please?

00:53:20.385 --> 00:53:21.637
Sure.

00:53:24.056 --> 00:53:25.766
I've been going crazy these days.

00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:29.102
Looks like there's an issue
with your address position.

00:53:29.186 --> 00:53:30.103
Is that so?

00:53:30.187 --> 00:53:32.731
If your right arm is bent,
your backswing can be too fast,

00:53:32.815 --> 00:53:34.358
and you're more likely to slice.

00:53:34.441 --> 00:53:36.109
Darn it.

00:53:36.193 --> 00:53:38.278
I should have shown it to you sooner.

00:53:39.321 --> 00:53:40.572
Gosh, so much traffic.

00:53:40.656 --> 00:53:42.783
Sorry, Nak-su.
I'll hop into the front seat in a minute.

00:53:42.866 --> 00:53:45.536
Don't worry.
Whatever feels comfortable for you.

00:53:45.619 --> 00:53:48.038
The back seat is so spacious.

00:53:48.121 --> 00:53:49.581
Right?

00:53:49.665 --> 00:53:51.166
I'd love a big car like this.

00:53:51.959 --> 00:53:53.544
Okay. My right arm.

00:53:53.627 --> 00:53:55.295
-Mr. Baek.
-Yes.

00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:59.049
How's the new apartment?

00:53:59.716 --> 00:54:02.052
I'm only renting here monthly,
so it's temporary.

00:54:03.053 --> 00:54:05.264
You bought early
and pocketed some cash, huh?

00:54:05.347 --> 00:54:06.515
-Hardly.
-What?

00:54:06.598 --> 00:54:08.600
The price's gone up a bit
since I bought it.

00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:10.686
-Here.
-My right arm?

00:54:10.769 --> 00:54:13.021
-Yes, your right arm.
-He owns it!

00:54:14.231 --> 00:54:16.024
Why are you gaping like that?

00:54:20.904 --> 00:54:22.155
Shall I drive?

00:54:23.031 --> 00:54:24.324
-Can you…
-Shall I?

00:54:24.408 --> 00:54:25.325
Thank you.

00:54:26.493 --> 00:54:29.913
You get a turn, and I get a turn.
It sounds sweet,

00:54:29.997 --> 00:54:32.457
but it's also perfect
for drawing unnecessary suspicion.

00:54:32.541 --> 00:54:33.417
RIVER PALACE PRICES

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:34.668
Jeez, come on.

00:54:34.751 --> 00:54:37.504
Don't be so pessimistic.

00:54:37.588 --> 00:54:40.632
If you think about the bidding price,
it's a risk worth taking.

00:54:40.716 --> 00:54:41.842
6.8 BILLION
6.7 BILLION

00:54:41.925 --> 00:54:43.886
I'm not sure.

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:50.309
Going with a separate contract structure…

00:54:50.976 --> 00:54:52.519
Did he come just to play around?

00:54:53.437 --> 00:54:56.148
ACT won't be the only one
who will benefit from it.

00:54:56.231 --> 00:54:57.608
Nak-su!

00:54:57.691 --> 00:54:58.817
What are you doing? Come!

00:54:58.901 --> 00:55:00.193
Yes, sir.

00:55:01.278 --> 00:55:02.362
KIM NAK-SU

00:55:15.709 --> 00:55:19.296
I always crush him
whenever we bet on golf.

00:55:19.796 --> 00:55:21.673
He's a total sucker.

00:55:22.174 --> 00:55:23.926
Still, his form's actually pretty solid.

00:55:24.676 --> 00:55:25.886
-You think?
-Yes. Look at him.

00:55:25.969 --> 00:55:28.263
He's not using any unnecessary force.

00:55:29.097 --> 00:55:30.515
He must have inherited it.

00:55:31.058 --> 00:55:33.393
Maybe not. Sneaky bastard.

00:55:33.477 --> 00:55:36.521
Acting all honorable,
acting like he's not into investments.

00:55:36.605 --> 00:55:37.522
What a phony bastard.

00:55:37.606 --> 00:55:39.149
Just wait. I'll get there.

00:55:40.359 --> 00:55:41.360
I'll get there.

00:55:41.443 --> 00:55:44.613
I'll become an executive

00:55:45.238 --> 00:55:48.200
and make my way
to Gangnam, Seocho, and Hannam.

00:55:48.283 --> 00:55:49.701
Good shot.

00:56:03.548 --> 00:56:04.716
It went in.

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:06.510
-Hole-in-one!
-It went in!

00:56:08.261 --> 00:56:09.638
-What the heck?
-A hole-in-one?

00:56:09.721 --> 00:56:10.889
-Hey!
-Oh my.

00:56:10.973 --> 00:56:12.724
It's a hole-in-one!

00:56:14.601 --> 00:56:16.353
That's a hole-in-one!

00:56:16.895 --> 00:56:18.313
Mr. Baek!

00:56:20.107 --> 00:56:21.608
I can't believe that went in.

00:56:21.692 --> 00:56:25.070
It's been 15 years, but I've never
claimed my hole-in-one insurance.

00:56:25.153 --> 00:56:26.738
You've got coverage, right?

00:56:26.822 --> 00:56:28.615
No, I don't.

00:56:28.699 --> 00:56:29.950
Not even one-day coverage?

00:56:30.033 --> 00:56:31.034
No.

00:56:36.206 --> 00:56:37.791
KIM NAK-SU

00:56:37.874 --> 00:56:39.209
I mean, nothing's impossible.

00:56:39.292 --> 00:56:40.293
CONGRATULATIONS
HOLE-IN-ONE

00:56:40.377 --> 00:56:42.004
Mr. Hole-in-One, stand in the center.

00:56:42.087 --> 00:56:43.588
-Come to the center.
-I'm good.

00:56:43.672 --> 00:56:45.048
Come on.

00:56:45.132 --> 00:56:47.175
-The star of the day.
-Closer, please.

00:56:47.259 --> 00:56:48.427
Here we go.

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:50.679
One, two, three.

00:56:50.762 --> 00:56:53.015
Good! Let's see some bigger smiles.

00:56:59.855 --> 00:57:02.566
DREAM BANK

00:57:02.649 --> 00:57:04.151
Thank you for today.

00:57:04.234 --> 00:57:06.278
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:57:06.361 --> 00:57:08.238
-Right. And sir?
-Yes.

00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:10.198
You're getting
the commemorative ball, right?

00:57:10.282 --> 00:57:11.199
A commemorative ball?

00:57:11.283 --> 00:57:13.076
This is a real good-luck charm.

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:14.286
Everyone buys one.

00:57:17.247 --> 00:57:18.290
Sure.

00:57:18.373 --> 00:57:20.792
-Go for it all.
-I'll ring it up for you.

00:57:32.345 --> 00:57:33.430
There.

00:57:33.513 --> 00:57:35.932
This is where it gets really amazing.

00:57:36.016 --> 00:57:38.727
This one's called the Nak-su Bomb!

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:40.145
Down it goes!

00:57:43.231 --> 00:57:44.858
Pour it all in.

00:57:44.941 --> 00:57:46.943
-All right.
-What?

00:57:47.027 --> 00:57:49.988
The last par!

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.701
We are no longer competitors.

00:57:54.785 --> 00:57:56.495
We're partners!

00:57:56.578 --> 00:57:58.747
Let's love each other!

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:00.540
-Love each other!
-Love each other!

00:58:04.711 --> 00:58:06.213
Let's order some more meat.

00:58:06.296 --> 00:58:08.256
-Shall we?
-Eight more servings!

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:09.716
That will be 2,490,000 won.

00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:11.968
Sorry?

00:58:12.052 --> 00:58:13.512
It's 2,490,000 won.

00:58:14.387 --> 00:58:15.806
Right.

00:58:15.889 --> 00:58:17.599
Shall I chip in?

00:58:17.682 --> 00:58:19.392
Goodness. Just go already.

00:58:19.476 --> 00:58:20.352
-Take him.
-Okay.

00:58:20.435 --> 00:58:22.229
I'll pay in full.

00:58:22.312 --> 00:58:23.188
Here.

00:58:24.022 --> 00:58:25.315
In full.

00:58:26.608 --> 00:58:27.901
What do I do now?

00:58:27.984 --> 00:58:28.860
RECEIPT

00:58:33.782 --> 00:58:35.283
Mr. Baek.

00:58:39.412 --> 00:58:41.081
Holy cow!

00:58:42.332 --> 00:58:43.667
Be careful.

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:45.585
-Is this pure gold?
-I paid 1.5 million won.

00:58:46.711 --> 00:58:48.755
We should have bought it for you.

00:58:48.839 --> 00:58:49.965
Please. That's not necessary.

00:58:50.048 --> 00:58:52.634
You did a good job.

00:58:52.717 --> 00:58:55.303
You need to pay good money
for something like this.

00:58:55.387 --> 00:58:56.763
That was no ordinary luck.

00:58:56.847 --> 00:58:58.807
That was a stroke of great fortune!

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.768
My number one treasure,

00:59:01.852 --> 00:59:03.478
Kim Nak-su!

00:59:04.813 --> 00:59:06.273
The managing director.

00:59:07.482 --> 00:59:08.859
Thank you.

00:59:08.942 --> 00:59:10.235
Okay.

00:59:13.446 --> 00:59:15.532
Let's have coffee in my office
this afternoon.

00:59:15.615 --> 00:59:16.658
Okay.

00:59:18.743 --> 00:59:21.204
Your boss scored a hole-in-one.

00:59:21.288 --> 00:59:22.664
Take good care of him.

00:59:24.708 --> 00:59:27.419
You know how crucial this is, right?

00:59:29.254 --> 00:59:31.047
Let's have a successful
first half of the year.

00:59:31.131 --> 00:59:33.175
Numbers make the man.

00:59:33.258 --> 00:59:34.217
Yes, sir.

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:39.681
Bye, sir.

00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:43.977
-Bye, sir.
-All right.

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:47.147
Mr. Kim, I did the final check,
and there's something ambiguous.

00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:48.148
Ambiguous?

00:59:48.231 --> 00:59:50.275
The estimate for
the Yangpyeong Dream Cultural Center

00:59:50.358 --> 00:59:53.236
is a bit ambiguous,
so I'd like for you to take a look.

00:59:55.363 --> 00:59:56.323
What's ambiguous?

00:59:56.406 --> 00:59:59.242
The quote was based on Super Giga,

00:59:59.326 --> 01:00:01.953
but this area isn't covered yet.

01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:08.293
CONSTRUCTION MAP
SCHEDULED FOR AUGUST 2025

01:00:08.376 --> 01:00:10.921
That's not true. They're getting
Giga Internet starting in August.

01:00:11.004 --> 01:00:13.715
Yes, but we have to start
the service next week.

01:00:14.758 --> 01:00:16.760
What? Is there a problem?

01:00:16.843 --> 01:00:18.762
No, sir.

01:00:19.721 --> 01:00:20.805
What's there to worry about?

01:00:22.265 --> 01:00:24.893
Get it installed.
It's just a few months at most.

01:00:24.976 --> 01:00:26.770
-No need to hesitate. Come on.
-Okay.

01:00:28.438 --> 01:00:29.564
Come see me around 2:00 p.m.

01:00:29.648 --> 01:00:30.607
I will.

01:00:32.609 --> 01:00:34.069
-Bye, sir.
-Bye, sir.

01:00:38.698 --> 01:00:39.616
Hey.

01:00:40.575 --> 01:00:43.245
They won't be doing
any speed checks or anything,

01:00:43.328 --> 01:00:45.997
but make sure nothing goes wrong, okay?

01:00:46.915 --> 01:00:49.542
-You know what I mean, right?
-Yes, sir.

01:00:49.626 --> 01:00:51.211
-Hello.
-Long time no see.

01:01:02.681 --> 01:01:04.099
Hello.

01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:05.141
It's been a while.

01:01:06.768 --> 01:01:07.894
What brings you here?

01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:13.692
I just…

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.155
Have you eaten?

01:01:20.156 --> 01:01:21.241
No.

01:01:22.409 --> 01:01:24.703
Let's go. Give me a second.

01:01:31.376 --> 01:01:32.627
Is there absolutely no way?

01:01:34.587 --> 01:01:37.257
I guess I can arrange
a meeting over a meal.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:40.051
That's more than enough.
I'll take care of the rest.

01:01:42.679 --> 01:01:44.889
The HR team already made the call.

01:01:44.973 --> 01:01:47.434
I don't see how Jeong-tae
can get you out of this.

01:01:49.102 --> 01:01:50.645
Still, I need to try.

01:01:56.401 --> 01:01:57.610
Nak-su, I…

01:01:59.070 --> 01:02:02.157
I go up and down those manholes
dozens of times a day,

01:02:04.242 --> 01:02:05.702
opening and closing the lids.

01:02:08.371 --> 01:02:09.998
But it's so dark down there.

01:02:12.917 --> 01:02:15.253
I really feel
like I'm going to die, Nak-su.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:19.591
I bet those bastards

01:02:20.759 --> 01:02:23.428
never planned on sending me
to Ulleungdo in the first place.

01:02:23.511 --> 01:02:26.473
Looking at it now, they just want me
to quit on my own.

01:02:26.556 --> 01:02:27.891
Buddy.

01:02:29.351 --> 01:02:31.311
Did you only just figure that out?

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.189
-What?
-I'll be straight with you.

01:02:34.272 --> 01:02:37.484
I feel embarrassed
about having to go to Jeong-tae and say,

01:02:37.567 --> 01:02:40.653
"My buddy's about to get demoted.
Could you please look out for him?"

01:02:40.737 --> 01:02:42.447
At a time like this,

01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:45.617
I don't want to sound
like I'm oblivious to reality.

01:02:46.534 --> 01:02:47.744
I'm desperate too.

01:02:47.827 --> 01:02:50.455
I've been a general manager for six years.
This is my last year.

01:02:50.538 --> 01:02:54.167
You think I don't notice how the company
pampers that kid, Do Jin-woo?

01:02:56.669 --> 01:02:58.505
But we're colleagues.

01:02:59.089 --> 01:03:00.965
We came in together, Nak-su.

01:03:01.049 --> 01:03:03.426
Stop making that face. I'm so sick of it.

01:03:05.553 --> 01:03:06.971
Stop acting like you're the victim.

01:03:07.055 --> 01:03:08.890
I'm the victim, not you.

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:23.655
-Song-hee.
-Yes, sir.

01:03:46.219 --> 01:03:48.847
-Here.
-Thank you.

01:03:54.102 --> 01:03:56.521
I know you're up for a promotion

01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:59.190
to assistant manager next year,

01:04:00.108 --> 01:04:01.234
but…

01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:05.321
how about you get it the year after next

01:04:06.072 --> 01:04:07.282
when you turn 30?

01:04:08.575 --> 01:04:09.451
Sorry?

01:04:09.534 --> 01:04:10.702
The thing is,

01:04:10.785 --> 01:04:14.581
Tae-hwan hasn't even made
senior manager in over ten years.

01:04:14.664 --> 01:04:17.250
I'm not saying this because
he and I came in together.

01:04:17.333 --> 01:04:18.793
For our team's morale--

01:04:18.877 --> 01:04:20.295
Did I underperform this year?

01:04:22.005 --> 01:04:24.382
You did great, but…

01:04:25.633 --> 01:04:27.969
If everyone gets the same evaluation,
he won't stand out.

01:04:28.052 --> 01:04:32.390
So if the team members sacrifice a little

01:04:32.474 --> 01:04:35.810
and let Tae-hwan
take the credit, you know?

01:04:36.352 --> 01:04:38.188
You know what I mean, right?

01:04:40.023 --> 01:04:40.940
No, I don't.

01:04:42.734 --> 01:04:45.737
No, you're smart. I'm sure you do.

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:47.864
Go get Sung-gu for me.

01:04:47.947 --> 01:04:50.283
-Mr. Kim.
-You'll get a good evaluation next year.

01:04:50.366 --> 01:04:51.743
Go get Sung-gu.

01:05:10.303 --> 01:05:11.346
Just to promote you,

01:05:11.429 --> 01:05:13.681
I stalled everyone else
on our team for one or two years.

01:05:13.765 --> 01:05:16.184
What more could I have done?

01:05:16.726 --> 01:05:18.770
I get it. You must feel wronged

01:05:18.853 --> 01:05:20.063
and betrayed by the company.

01:05:20.146 --> 01:05:22.899
Sure, it's inhumane.
Maybe even brutal. I know.

01:05:24.275 --> 01:05:26.444
But come on, the company is not a charity.

01:05:27.403 --> 01:05:30.448
For 25 years, whether you did well or not,
the company paid you every month.

01:05:30.532 --> 01:05:33.826
Sounds to me like the company's done
its share, don't you think?

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:42.919
Tae-hwan,

01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:45.296
accept the reality now.

01:05:46.047 --> 01:05:47.632
And go find another job

01:05:48.383 --> 01:05:51.052
where you can be treated
with some respect.

01:05:51.553 --> 01:05:53.846
I think that's the right thing to do.

01:05:58.601 --> 01:06:00.478
-Nak-su.
-Yes.

01:06:01.521 --> 01:06:03.731
It looks like you'll become an executive.

01:06:05.233 --> 01:06:07.569
Cut the sarcasm, man.

01:06:10.613 --> 01:06:11.739
I'll get going then.

01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:30.842
Yes. How many times do I have to tell you?

01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:33.428
Yes.

01:06:35.054 --> 01:06:36.472
You made the right decision.

01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:40.810
That's it! We can do this!

01:06:42.895 --> 01:06:43.813
Yes.

01:07:01.205 --> 01:07:06.669
"JUST LIKE HOW YOU LEFT ME WITH A SMILE"
LEE EUN-HA

01:07:07.962 --> 01:07:09.339
Okay, Mr. Choi.

01:07:10.006 --> 01:07:12.508
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

01:07:18.348 --> 01:07:21.351
Nak-su, the conversation went well.

01:07:21.434 --> 01:07:23.061
Whenever there's a government bid,

01:07:23.144 --> 01:07:25.897
the three companies
will pull together from now on.

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:28.107
That's good news.

01:07:28.191 --> 01:07:29.901
It's all thanks to your hole-in-one.

01:07:29.984 --> 01:07:31.361
Please.

01:07:31.444 --> 01:07:32.862
Everyone just loved the energy.

01:07:34.072 --> 01:07:35.615
-Well done.
-Thank you.

01:07:36.741 --> 01:07:37.992
-Bro.
-Yes.

01:07:38.076 --> 01:07:39.661
I have something to ask you.

01:07:39.744 --> 01:07:41.788
Go on.

01:07:43.247 --> 01:07:46.709
Those cruel HR bastards.

01:07:48.252 --> 01:07:50.046
I think they took it a little far.

01:07:50.129 --> 01:07:52.131
-But Nak-su.
-Yes.

01:07:53.633 --> 01:07:56.302
I'm the one who made the call on Tae-hwan.

01:07:58.763 --> 01:07:59.681
A month ago,

01:07:59.764 --> 01:08:02.558
HR asked me for a list of underperformers

01:08:02.642 --> 01:08:04.268
in the sales division.

01:08:05.812 --> 01:08:07.397
I kind of knew what was going on,

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:10.066
but I didn't know you made that call.

01:08:10.149 --> 01:08:12.235
I didn't know
they'd ship him off to Ulleungdo.

01:08:12.318 --> 01:08:13.903
That was too harsh.

01:08:15.822 --> 01:08:18.449
I'm the one who handed them the list,

01:08:18.533 --> 01:08:22.203
so I can't exactly go back on my word now.

01:08:22.286 --> 01:08:23.746
You know what I mean, right?

01:08:24.497 --> 01:08:25.373
Sorry?

01:08:27.959 --> 01:08:29.460
Yes, I understand.

01:08:30.002 --> 01:08:31.796
You two started together, right?

01:08:31.879 --> 01:08:32.755
Yes.

01:08:33.798 --> 01:08:36.968
I know you've been helping him
here and there.

01:08:37.635 --> 01:08:39.762
You've done enough.

01:08:39.846 --> 01:08:42.515
It's time to think about yourself
and move on.

01:08:43.307 --> 01:08:44.308
Look.

01:08:44.892 --> 01:08:47.145
You cause a stir over something like this,

01:08:47.228 --> 01:08:49.981
and it will count against
your promotion to executive.

01:08:50.064 --> 01:08:52.191
Tell him to think it over.

01:08:52.275 --> 01:08:54.527
It could be better for him
to walk away now.

01:08:55.194 --> 01:08:58.740
The severance budgets
for voluntary retirement are fixed.

01:08:59.449 --> 01:09:03.161
If he applies late, it will run out.
He won't get anything.

01:09:07.498 --> 01:09:11.085
He might actually be better off
if he opened a dealership or something.

01:09:12.754 --> 01:09:14.756
-I'll talk to him about it.
-Okay.

01:09:14.839 --> 01:09:17.383
Tell him to stay away from trouble.

01:09:18.259 --> 01:09:20.762
I will. If you'll excuse me now.

01:09:20.845 --> 01:09:22.013
-Nak-su.
-Yes.

01:09:22.096 --> 01:09:23.723
I'm feeling the good vibe.

01:09:25.308 --> 01:09:27.769
Let's do well this year

01:09:27.852 --> 01:09:29.520
and deliver great results.

01:09:29.604 --> 01:09:30.772
Okay.

01:09:33.191 --> 01:09:34.525
What the heck?

01:09:38.029 --> 01:09:39.864
They locked down the parking lot.

01:09:42.742 --> 01:09:44.327
What for?

01:09:45.578 --> 01:09:46.913
A SAFETY INCIDENT HAS OCCURRED

01:09:46.996 --> 01:09:48.706
Jeez. I need to get going soon.

01:09:49.373 --> 01:09:50.750
Has there been an accident?

01:10:04.931 --> 01:10:08.351
I just talked to Jeong-tae.

01:10:09.101 --> 01:10:11.395
Hello, is this
Mr. Heo Tae-hwan's emergency contact?

01:10:11.479 --> 01:10:12.355
Sorry?

01:10:12.438 --> 01:10:14.982
It's an emergency.
Are you Mr. Heo's emergency contact?

01:10:16.484 --> 01:10:17.610
Hello?

01:10:18.194 --> 01:10:19.278
Hello?

01:10:21.572 --> 01:10:23.616
Wake up! Hurry!

01:10:52.228 --> 01:10:55.147
THE DREAM LIFE OF MR. KIM

01:11:26.262 --> 01:11:28.723
The reporters seem to have caught on.

01:11:28.806 --> 01:11:31.475
Go and smooth things over in advance.

01:11:31.559 --> 01:11:34.312
I rose through the ranks
without skipping a single promotion.

01:11:34.395 --> 01:11:37.940
And recently,
I secured a major project by myself.

01:11:39.901 --> 01:11:41.652
Nak-su, why is your team falling

01:11:41.736 --> 01:11:44.238
-so far behind Do Jin-woo's?
-Rock, paper, scissors!

01:11:44.322 --> 01:11:47.116
Do you want to join
your father's company after graduating?

01:11:47.199 --> 01:11:48.534
No, of course not!

01:11:49.368 --> 01:11:51.203
How about working with us?

01:11:52.246 --> 01:11:54.332
You survived as a general manager
at a big company,

01:11:54.415 --> 01:11:56.792
bought an apartment in Seoul,
and sent me to college. So what?

01:11:56.876 --> 01:11:58.711
You'll have to choose someone else.

01:11:58.794 --> 01:12:01.923
A senior manager or higher
with over 20 years at the company.

01:12:02.006 --> 01:12:03.591
I'll be an executive next year.

01:12:03.674 --> 01:12:04.675
Awesome!

01:12:04.759 --> 01:12:06.928
I'm 99.9 percent sure. Got that?

01:12:11.349 --> 01:12:13.351
