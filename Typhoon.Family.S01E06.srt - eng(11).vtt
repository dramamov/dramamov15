TYPHOON FAMILY

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.548
Can you put your eyes on the line?

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:50.842
What's wrong?

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:52.302
You scared?

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.428
You have to swear

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.765
to leave us alone
once you get 100 million won.

00:00:58.641 --> 00:00:59.601
What's wrong?

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:01.936
You scared?

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:15.575
What's your name?

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.285
That's none of your business.

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:21.331
I'm just a trader…

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:25.710
from Typhoon Trading.

DEBT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM
COLLATERAL: TWO EYEBALLS

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.150
Damn it!

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.245
This is tough.

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:20.765
Shall I…

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:24.602
start doing some business?

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:32.277
EPISODE 6
THE LEGEND OF AMBITION

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:43.913
Tae-poong!

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.457
Hey!

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.042
Hey, Tae-poong! You punk.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.713
How the heck could you just run off
and leave me with this guy?

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:52.755
Gosh.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.467
I got scared after seeing a loan shark
for the first time in my life.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:57.427
Scared?

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.014
If you get scared twice,
you'll level the whole damn block!

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:04.767
-What now?
-What?

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:10.481
I'm sure he's thanking you.
No one on earth is like you.

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:12.775
You should've come yesterday.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.778
I was beaten up badly yesterday.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.948
Darn it! I'm so done with this!

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:21.743
Jeez.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:23.745
Yesterday?

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:28.541
This is too much.
Why did I get caught up in this?

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:32.378
Hey, let's at least drop him off
at a hospital before we go.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:33.379
I can't do this.

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.258
One, two, three!

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.971
Can you take me home
instead of to the hospital?

00:03:58.488 --> 00:03:59.822
-Here?
-The lights are on.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.325
One moment, please.

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:06.412
I got…

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:11.501
How do I look?

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:15.380
I don't look like
I've been beaten up, do I?

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:20.385
Even people about 100 m away from you
can clearly tell you were beaten up.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:21.928
-You're all swollen.
-Yes.

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:22.971
Is that so?

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:25.556
That's not good.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:30.144
By any chance,
do you have any makeup I can use?

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:32.897
I don't. I'm not wearing any makeup.

00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:35.775
I may not look like it,
but I never use foundation.

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:38.319
Don't be so harsh, and let me borrow some.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.822
I can probably scrape some off your face.

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:43.157
How dare you? I'll break your fingers.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.701
Is she your daughter?

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:47.578
She's not asleep, is she?

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.915
I can't spend the night out tonight.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.751
What do I do now?

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.255
-Give me a moment. Let's see.
-What?

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:02.093
If you had a kid,
you should've just said so.

00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:05.638
-Careful.
-It must hurt.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.308
-Be gentle. Okay.
-I'll put thick makeup on you.

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.530
Daddy!

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.366
Oh, gosh.

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:30.997
I'm so sorry
for leaving you here all alone, Bo-ram.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.207
It's okay. I'm a brave girl.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.463
Anyway, what is this?
Christmas has passed long ago.

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:43.593
I wanted to give you a present,
so I came here on Rudolph. Here it is.

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:47.472
Who did you take after
and become so smart?

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:50.683
-I took after my daddy.
-Hey, don't say that.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.063
Do you want to blow this out, Bo-ram?

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.652
You're Uncle Crazy Tae-poong, right?

00:06:03.404 --> 00:06:06.532
Uncle Crazy Tae-poong?
Yes, that's me, Uncle Crazy Tae-poong.

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:09.994
-You're good-looking.
-I am?

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.245
Thank you.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:16.876
Thank you so much for this.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:19.879
Sure.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:22.256
Should we eat cake?

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.508
-Yes.
-Let's eat it.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.718
Let's eat cake. Let me bring some dishes.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.679
Daddy, this is so cute.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.098
-Is it?
-Yes.

00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:51.869
Hello?

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:53.621
Were you asleep?

00:06:53.704 --> 00:06:54.664
No.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.084
Are you done with work?

00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:01.504
Yes, I'm taking the bus back now.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:03.464
Good work.

00:07:05.424 --> 00:07:06.425
Well…

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:09.804
Ms. Oh.

00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:11.347
Yes, please speak.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.015
Well…

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:17.979
Is there no sentiment in this work?

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.690
-What?
-You know, sentiment.

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:25.153
Like love, justice,

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.448
or faith, something of that sort.

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:32.743
Never mind.

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.831
Don't I sound like a fool for asking this?

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:39.417
Those can't even be seen.

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:41.836
Mr. Kang.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.340
Will you look up at the sky?

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:52.180
Do you see the stars?

00:07:53.764 --> 00:07:54.724
I don't.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:57.768
It's way too cloudy.

00:07:57.852 --> 00:08:02.148
Does that mean they don't exist
just because you don't see them now?

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:10.281
You're right.

00:08:12.116 --> 00:08:13.367
Please return safely.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.924
Why are you smiling?

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.594
-What?
-Why are you smiling alone?

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:32.970
Don't mind me. Oh, right.

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:35.765
Turn on the TV.
Let's watch the New Year's bell ceremony.

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:39.227
That ceremony happens every single year.
Why do you have to see it?

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.020
You always want to watch it!

00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:56.118
TICKETS

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:57.537
Wait…

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:00.039
What?

00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:02.250
EXPRESS BUS WINDOW CLOSED
FOR 1997 AS OF 23:00

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:16.514
-We're witnessing a historic moment.
-Telemarketing?

00:09:16.597 --> 00:09:19.475
-We're at Bosingak for the ceremony.
-Make money while chatting?

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.394
Once the Bosingak Bell strikes 33 times…

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:25.273
-We will now welcome 1998.
-A skillful cook?

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:28.150
-There're 20 people from different fields.
-That's me.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.819
-They'll help us ring the bell.
-What else?

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:35.491
Among them, there is a hero
who comforted us the most this year.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.827
It's Coach Cha Bum-kun
of the national soccer team.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.706
Look at you. Your handsome face is ruined.

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:44.083
We're about to say
goodbye to the awfully eventful 1997

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:48.921
as everyone here anticipates
and dreams of a better tomorrow.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:53.593
May only warm laughter
and good things fill our new year.

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.261
Is that helpful?

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:57.555
-We're at Bosingak.
-This keeps moisture in my skin.

00:09:57.638 --> 00:09:59.557
-It is full of passion here.
-Look.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.058
I'm just hoping the bell rings soon.

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:04.103
-Grandma, they're striking the bell.
-Ten seconds left.

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:07.440
-Eight, seven, six…
-Eight, seven, six…

00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:09.191
-Five, four…
-…five, four,

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:12.278
-three, two, one…
-Don't eat it, Grandma! It's dirty!

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:17.783
Happy New Year, Grandma!

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:21.662
-Wonderful.
-You always get excited about that.

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:25.166
Why can't they hit it harder?
It's always a very low ding.

00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:27.251
-It's so frustrating.
-It's cold.

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:28.794
1998 CALENDAR
HAPPY NEW YEAR

00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:30.546
1
JANUARY

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.465
Did you eat a piece of cucumber?

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.677
The nights seemed
especially longer this winter.

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:42.058
The deeper the night is, the sooner
the sun will rise in the morning.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.886
It was so nearby.

00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:20.679
The sentiment.

00:11:35.903 --> 00:11:36.737
Ms. Oh!

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:51.794
-You should've gone home to get some rest.
-No, I had a good night's sleep.

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:53.504
-Did you?
-Yes. Oh, right!

00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:02.096
Were the products not there?

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:05.099
-It's okay. We just--
-No.

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:08.436
I got the products.

00:12:11.355 --> 00:12:12.273
Over there.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.257
There's quite a bit.

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:40.926
-A bit?
-Yes.

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:51.187
Yes, just a bit.

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.606
How many is a bit?

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:58.569
-It should be about five…
-Five hundred pairs?

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:02.406
More like 6,500.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.744
Is this it? It's not as bad as I thought.

00:13:06.827 --> 00:13:09.121
-It's that way, the back alley.
-Is that so?

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:11.040
-Is there coffee?
-What now?

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:14.543
I always have coffee in the morning.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.795
Wait, how many pairs?

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:19.298
-Hey, we brought 7,000. Let's go.
-If not, I'll buy some.

00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:21.383
-No, there's coffee around here.
-It's 7,000?

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.802
I like the brand Rich Aroma,
but you don't drink that.

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.931
I like that because I'm a fan
of the actor, Ahn Sung-ki.

00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:27.932
-Are you?
-Yes.

00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:29.934
It may seem like a lot,

00:13:30.017 --> 00:13:32.478
but we can sell everything
in three months, right?

00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:36.190
We're going to be rich now.

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.488
You must be out of your mind!

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:48.452
Ms. Oh!

00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:57.253
The more I get to know coffee,

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:01.715
the more I become drawn
to this rich aroma.

00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:04.927
Rich Aroma.

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:09.682
Coffee is best in the American style.

00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:14.478
-What's the ratio?
-Two coffee, four sugar, and four cream.

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:17.856
Americans take their coffee sweet.

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:21.569
-Is that so?
-Stop complaining. It's past due.

00:14:21.652 --> 00:14:23.153
Pay me back by tomorrow, you punk!

00:14:24.738 --> 00:14:27.950
All these infantile punks
are talking total bullshit to me.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.081
Infantile…

00:14:34.748 --> 00:14:36.876
I have no idea what she just said.

00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:47.553
CPU, 116 MB. Memory, 1.2 GB. Hard disk…

00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:49.889
You're running low on the hard disk space.

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:53.058
-How did you know?
-I was formerly an engineer.

00:14:53.767 --> 00:14:54.935
Did you major in engineering?

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:57.688
I went to the Maritime University,
not engineering.

00:14:57.771 --> 00:14:58.898
Maritime University?

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:04.862
I studied ships and boats,
mostly large vessels, like Captain Nemo.

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:08.866
Captain Harlock is the best captain.

00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:12.828
No, the best captain out there
is Spock of Star Trek.

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:19.418
Live long and prosper.

00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:22.338
Do you know this?

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:24.465
-Of course, I do!
-What about this?

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:32.139
-How do you know this?
-I'm a huge fan of Star Trek.

00:15:32.222 --> 00:15:36.101
-By any chance, are you on Cheonrian?
-Just a little.

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.562
It's great to meet you.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:39.688
What now?

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:44.944
How is 500 the same as 7,000?
This is such an absurd amount.

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:48.197
Construction projects have stopped,
including the airport. Who'll buy those?

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.491
We should export those.

00:15:50.574 --> 00:15:53.035
That's even harder to do
than selling domestically!

00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:57.998
Why do you think that way?
This means we have more opportunities.

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:01.418
-Opportunities?
-Yes, opportunities.

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.922
Good luck with that opportunity then.

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:07.549
-Wait.
-Hey.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.259
-Mi-seon!
-Wait…

00:16:10.594 --> 00:16:11.929
I knew this would happen.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:14.723
Hey, Mi-seon!

00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:23.732
I've never seen
Ms. Oh that furious before.

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:27.486
Let me know if there's anything I can do.

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:29.405
Close the door and leave.

00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:30.739
Shall we?

00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:39.957
-Anyway, when will others come to work?
-This is everyone.

00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:42.960
-This is it?
-Yes.

00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:45.546
It's just Mr. Kang and Ms. Oh.

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:49.299
-What about you?
-Me?

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:51.802
I'm family.

00:16:51.885 --> 00:16:52.886
A freeloader.

00:16:58.851 --> 00:16:59.852
Family.

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:02.771
Freeloader.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:24.001
SELF-INSPECTION

00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:46.023
You must've been a rich lady
who used to live in Gangnam.

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:52.279
-Well, I just look rich.
-You're really bad.

00:17:52.362 --> 00:17:54.656
You're so bad at your job.

00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:57.701
I've run this factory for 20 years,

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.039
and you were the first assistant who left
after finishing a box of bandages.

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.504
Are you firing me?

00:18:11.548 --> 00:18:14.134
Come half an hour early starting tomorrow.

00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:17.471
Even if you do, you still won't finish
half of what others can.

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:33.153
What can I get with this?

00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:44.832
Hey.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.876
Do you work here?

00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:54.091
Hey, do you want me
to make you something delicious?

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:58.178
In return, you have to keep a secret
between you and me.

00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:00.139
A secret?

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:08.313
Does that upset you that much?
Why are you so upset?

00:19:09.189 --> 00:19:10.482
Worried the company will go under?

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:13.694
Then come and work for me.
I'll pay you twice as much.

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.156
Mr. Kang made this decision by himself.

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:19.241
So what?

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:21.493
-Do you think he disregarded you?
-No.

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:25.831
Gosh, Mi-seon.

00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:33.463
What did you lose?

00:19:35.048 --> 00:19:37.968
Tae-poong lost everything
except for the name of the business.

00:19:38.051 --> 00:19:41.763
What did you bet in this business
to act like you're equal to him?

00:19:44.474 --> 00:19:47.144
Yes, what he did was wrong.

00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:50.147
However, work is different.

00:19:55.402 --> 00:20:00.282
SAVING ENERGY WILL TURN INTO ABUNDANCE

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:02.993
Gosh, come on.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:09.833
Where did Ms. Oh go?

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:21.553
Yes?

00:20:32.147 --> 00:20:35.275
-You should go if you're that worried.
-I'm not.

00:20:38.987 --> 00:20:41.031
Anyway, are you sure about this?

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:45.494
-It gets freezing cold here.
-I even slept at the factory.

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:47.579
This feels like a hotel in comparison.

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:53.627
I think it'll be better
if you came home with me.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.087
Gosh.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:59.716
If I impose on you any more,
I won't be able to face you again.

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:01.927
I'll be fine. You should go.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.061
Please use this if it gets colder.
You'll find what you need in the pantry.

00:21:14.189 --> 00:21:15.399
Hey…

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:21.530
Never mind. Goodbye.

00:21:23.156 --> 00:21:24.324
Good night.

00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:26.034
-I'll turn the lights off.
-Okay.

00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:55.397
So why do you work?

00:22:01.945 --> 00:22:03.030
Be honest.

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:07.451
-For a man?
-No.

00:22:09.244 --> 00:22:10.370
I work…

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:14.916
for my dream.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.001
Your dream?

00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:24.926
Dream.

00:22:27.804 --> 00:22:30.182
-Make sure you achieve it.
-Okay.

00:22:30.265 --> 00:22:32.267
-Move it.
-Right. I'm sorry.

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.354
-Goodbye, then.
-Bye.

00:22:40.358 --> 00:22:41.860
Keep driving straight.

00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:55.082
Ms. Oh!

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:06.301
Where have you been?
I was worried. Are you all right?

00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:08.512
I'm not.

00:23:09.513 --> 00:23:10.514
I'm sorry.

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:14.017
I promised not to make you mad, but…

00:23:21.983 --> 00:23:23.360
Wait, I have to use that.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.362
-What?
-My wish coupon.

00:23:25.445 --> 00:23:26.696
Sorry?

00:23:29.407 --> 00:23:33.954
WISH COUPON

00:23:51.638 --> 00:23:55.600
I wish Ms. Oh wouldn't be mad… No.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:01.231
I wish she would accept the apology
of Kang Tae-poong.

00:24:05.652 --> 00:24:06.653
You can't take it back.

00:24:11.783 --> 00:24:13.160
Fine.

00:24:16.413 --> 00:24:19.791
But promise me
you'll never act on your own again.

00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:21.710
I promise.

00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:25.297
Jeez.

00:24:27.215 --> 00:24:30.093
Is there anything else
you haven't told me yet?

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:33.013
Are you going to pull out
30,000 pairs of shoes tomorrow?

00:24:33.096 --> 00:24:35.432
Goodness, hardly.
I have nothing like that now.

00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:39.394
Well…

00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:47.152
Actually, I…

00:24:47.235 --> 00:24:49.571
Can you put your eyes on the line?

00:24:49.654 --> 00:24:52.490
Leave us alone
once you get 100 million won.

00:24:54.284 --> 00:24:58.663
I signed off my eyes to a loan shark--

00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:00.290
One more thing.

00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:03.793
You cannot get hurt.

00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:07.923
That's all I need from you.
If you remain healthy and well,

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.300
I promise I won't flip out.

00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:15.680
I'm sorry. What about your eyes?

00:25:16.264 --> 00:25:18.308
I did a staring contest with a loan shark.

00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:20.185
I see.

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:23.104
-Did you win?
-Yes, of course, I did.

00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:24.564
-I never lose.
-Is that so?

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:27.901
Hey…

00:25:31.529 --> 00:25:34.366
Never mind. Goodbye.

00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:39.496
Ms. Oh, you should go first.
I left something in the office.

00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:41.581
-You should go, okay?
-Yes, okay.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.793
-Thanks a lot.
-Sure.

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:47.796
Be careful. Don't run! Good grief.

00:25:48.421 --> 00:25:50.006
I just told him not to run.

00:26:04.854 --> 00:26:05.730
Oh, man.

00:26:35.468 --> 00:26:36.594
Darn it. Come on!

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.687
SEOUL EXPRESS BUS TERMINAL

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:55.905
Mr. Park.

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:57.449
I'm sorry.

00:27:07.917 --> 00:27:08.752
Mr. Park!

00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:12.047
I knew it.

00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:17.093
It's not even for Pusan, but Wando Island.

00:27:17.677 --> 00:27:18.553
Wando Island?

00:27:19.387 --> 00:27:20.347
Come with me.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.141
-Mr. Park!
-Get him!

00:27:24.225 --> 00:27:25.727
I'll pay for him later!

00:27:27.771 --> 00:27:29.022
Darn it!

00:27:34.527 --> 00:27:36.112
Jeez. Come on.

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:44.621
Seriously?

00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:57.342
I was the fastest runner in my class!

00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:05.058
-Hey!
-Wait!

00:28:05.141 --> 00:28:06.434
-Let go of me, you punk.
-No!

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:08.436
-We need to talk.
-Let go.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.896
Let go of me!

00:28:13.817 --> 00:28:16.194
So? Where are you going?

00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:26.371
I couldn't ask you before,
but come with me, Mr. Kang.

00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:30.708
There are so many isles
down in the Wando Island area

00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:33.711
that people can't find you
once you decide to hide.

00:28:34.462 --> 00:28:38.007
The world would've changed
after we spent a few years there.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.218
Why would I hide?

00:28:41.803 --> 00:28:43.263
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:28:44.305 --> 00:28:45.598
My goodness.

00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:51.938
I saw that Typhoon Trading
is also about to go under.

00:28:54.107 --> 00:28:56.526
So why did you get so nosy?

00:28:56.609 --> 00:28:59.279
I thought you had some money
when you blurted out something

00:28:59.362 --> 00:29:00.739
about 100 million won or whatever.

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:03.241
But all you have is that one female staff.

00:29:03.324 --> 00:29:05.118
How is that a decent business?

00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:07.537
At the very least,
I had 50 people on my payroll,

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.372
and I still couldn't make it.

00:29:09.956 --> 00:29:10.832
Exporting?

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:13.877
Do you think I haven't thought of that?

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:17.338
We can't compete
with China in this day and age!

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:21.217
They sell whatever they have
at less than half our price in the market.

00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:24.095
How will you sell those in three months
and make 100 million won?

00:29:28.057 --> 00:29:29.184
Forget everything else.

00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:34.522
What about Bo-ram?

00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:43.823
I sent her to my wife's family.
She'll be safer there.

00:29:43.907 --> 00:29:45.325
What about your staff at Shoe Park?

00:29:46.659 --> 00:29:50.079
So? What about them
who're working hard in this cold season?

00:29:50.163 --> 00:29:51.498
What can I do?

00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:55.126
Pusan is full of the unemployed.

00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:57.587
What about Shoe Park?

00:29:59.923 --> 00:30:01.674
What about 30 years of your life?

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:05.345
What about your patents?!

00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:09.516
Mr. Kang.

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:14.395
Do you know
what those loan sharks are like?

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:16.856
You saw me that day.

00:30:17.857 --> 00:30:21.444
They run their business
by selling people's bodies.

00:30:21.528 --> 00:30:24.489
I'd rather die
than to get dragged back there.

00:30:25.198 --> 00:30:28.535
Gosh, then just go and die!

00:30:30.119 --> 00:30:30.995
What?

00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:34.332
But before you do that,
we should try to sell these first!

00:30:34.916 --> 00:30:36.793
You haven't tried anything yet!

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:40.380
Right? I'm going to sell these!

00:30:41.923 --> 00:30:44.926
Are you not confident? But I am!

00:30:45.635 --> 00:30:46.553
Confidence?

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:49.681
Confidence isn't enough to pull this off.

00:30:49.764 --> 00:30:52.433
Everyone is shutting down
construction sites.

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:55.979
And you can't make 100 million won
by selling these to China or Saudi Arabia.

00:30:57.438 --> 00:30:58.648
Who will you sell them to?

00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:02.318
Where will you sell them?

00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:06.030
That's…

00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:09.659
IMPORTED FLOWERS FROM EUROPE

00:31:10.285 --> 00:31:11.744
-Over there. Look.
-Where?

00:31:12.829 --> 00:31:13.830
It went by.

00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:15.999
What went by?

00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:20.253
Ready?

00:31:20.336 --> 00:31:21.629
-Yes, I'm ready.
-Okay.

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:24.132
Mr. Kang, you can just walk up on the top.

00:31:29.345 --> 00:31:30.889
Get ready.

00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:40.356
Press the red button.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.484
Don't worry. I'm a veteran
in the Cheonrian Quiz Room.

00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:47.739
What did Mak-dong
give to Mi-ae in Green Fish?

00:31:47.822 --> 00:31:49.699
-A scarf.
-I knew it.

00:31:49.782 --> 00:31:50.992
-And the color?
-Red.

00:31:55.788 --> 00:31:59.584
Why did you suddenly jump off?
I haven't even taken the lens cover off.

00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:01.252
-What?
-One more time.

00:32:01.336 --> 00:32:03.129
Jump off after I say, "Ready, cue."

00:32:03.212 --> 00:32:04.547
All right. Here we go.

00:32:08.676 --> 00:32:11.429
I haven't even pressed the record button.

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:13.890
What's with you?

00:32:14.557 --> 00:32:17.852
-Give that to me. I'll do it better.
-No, this is my personal camcorder.

00:32:19.395 --> 00:32:21.272
KITT, let's do it over.

00:32:21.356 --> 00:32:23.316
-We can do this.
-From the top.

00:32:23.983 --> 00:32:24.984
Get ready.

00:32:25.068 --> 00:32:27.320
All right. Get ready.

00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:31.366
-Cue!
-Shoe Park Pro!

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.052
-Did it go well?
-Yes!

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:56.307
Hey, are you hurt? You're hurt!

00:32:57.016 --> 00:32:57.934
Let me see.

00:32:59.102 --> 00:33:00.144
You're bleeding.

00:33:02.689 --> 00:33:05.233
-Let me get some medicine.
-Why didn't you press stop sooner?

00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:08.069
-You ended up getting him hurt.
-People can make mistakes.

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:09.904
It's all right. Great job.

00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:11.572
He did a great job. Don't be harsh.

00:33:15.034 --> 00:33:16.536
-Just hold on for a second.
-Okay.

00:33:19.956 --> 00:33:21.666
-One moment.
-Okay.

00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:26.546
Hold on a little more.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.050
-You pressed it.
-I'm sorry.

00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:39.267
-You need to be careful.
-Okay, I'll be careful.

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:41.436
Aren't you hungry?

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.312
-I'm starving.
-Right?

00:33:43.396 --> 00:33:45.273
-Buns.
-I got some steamed buns.

00:33:53.239 --> 00:33:56.200
I really like this flavor.
Thank you so much.

00:33:57.618 --> 00:34:00.997
Wait, don't you think
the size difference is way too big?

00:34:02.957 --> 00:34:04.625
I like these too.

00:34:06.252 --> 00:34:09.213
-Eat up. Thanks.
-Okay, enjoy.

00:34:20.558 --> 00:34:21.559
It's good.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.855
-You know.
-Yes?

00:34:26.647 --> 00:34:29.692
Do we have to try so hard
with the video and all?

00:34:29.776 --> 00:34:33.780
I want to show them
our goods and our good taste

00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:35.156
since we're traders.

00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:40.453
Just wait. You'll live to see a day
when people watch everything in videos.

00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:44.665
People won't be able to resist buying
our product when they see it.

00:34:48.211 --> 00:34:51.672
I envy you for the ability
to instantly think like that.

00:34:53.466 --> 00:34:54.842
What do you mean?

00:34:56.302 --> 00:34:59.222
You'll have to perform
the most difficult task.

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:03.559
-Thanks.
-Sure.

00:35:11.484 --> 00:35:12.318
TYPHOON TRADING

00:35:19.075 --> 00:35:20.827
You cannot compromise your safety.

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:28.835
-I'm going to sell these at full price.
-How?

00:35:35.842 --> 00:35:36.843
UNITED STATES

00:35:36.926 --> 00:35:38.386
EUROPE

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:39.554
Like this.

00:35:41.848 --> 00:35:43.224
Are these all for America?

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:44.475
What's inside?

00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:46.602
Promotional material for safety shoes.

00:35:46.686 --> 00:35:49.856
-Let's end everything here.
-No, look.

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:52.233
The key is the payroll cost.

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:54.110
-The payroll cost?
-Yes.

00:35:54.193 --> 00:35:56.487
You saw those roses
at the Express Bus Terminal, right?

00:35:56.571 --> 00:35:57.655
They came from Europe,

00:35:57.738 --> 00:36:00.992
so there must be the logistics cost,
but those are expensive as is!

00:36:01.075 --> 00:36:04.328
-It was nice meeting you.
-Why? Because their wage is higher!

00:36:05.746 --> 00:36:07.415
-Please don't leave--
-Don't hold me back.

00:36:19.051 --> 00:36:21.762
-What are you doing?
-Hello, sir. I have a brochure.

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.764
I'm not a solicitor. It's just a brochure.

00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:25.892
You can't leave these here. Please leave.

00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:28.102
All right.

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:32.190
Asia still has much lower labor costs,
but it's exploding with manpower.

00:36:32.273 --> 00:36:34.150
Safety laws still aren't enough.

00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:37.528
What do you think
it's like in America or Europe?

00:36:38.654 --> 00:36:40.948
They'll have to pay medical expenses
and recruit new people.

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:43.451
And if things go haywire,
they'll end up with lawsuits.

00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:48.039
In such times, these shoes
will come in handy and prevent everything.

00:38:32.935 --> 00:38:34.186
FOR THE HIGHEST QUALITY

00:39:18.647 --> 00:39:21.734
It comes with five patents.

00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:30.117
This place is so clean.

00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:31.619
It's nice.

00:39:38.584 --> 00:39:39.502
Ms. Oh.

00:39:40.252 --> 00:39:41.754
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

00:39:42.505 --> 00:39:43.839
Did you not get enough sleep?

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:47.676
I was too nervous.
I had to memorize English lines.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.928
One second.

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:55.726
Are you nervous?

00:39:57.853 --> 00:39:59.105
I'm not nervous at all.

00:40:01.023 --> 00:40:03.192
I guess it's a difficult task,

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:07.988
but you're the best trader in our company.

00:40:11.158 --> 00:40:12.159
All done.

00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:15.913
You got this.

00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:17.998
I got this.

00:40:18.999 --> 00:40:21.085
-Let's go.
-Okay. Thanks.

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:36.869
Hello.

00:41:37.745 --> 00:41:38.913
I'm leaving first.

00:41:38.996 --> 00:41:39.872
See you tomorrow.

00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:44.418
-Did I keep you waiting?
-No, not for too long.

00:41:45.002 --> 00:41:46.045
Aren't you cold?

00:41:47.087 --> 00:41:48.589
-Are you cold?
-I am.

00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:51.592
My hands are freezing.

00:41:53.802 --> 00:41:54.637
One second.

00:41:58.265 --> 00:42:00.851
What? Why do you always give me this?

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.145
Because I can't hold your hand yet.

00:42:06.565 --> 00:42:08.400
But this gets cold quickly.

00:42:08.984 --> 00:42:11.487
-It's okay. I have more.
-Forget it.

00:42:15.449 --> 00:42:16.617
This way?

00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:18.452
This way.

00:42:20.955 --> 00:42:22.915
I have to get back to work now.

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:25.918
Okay. Bye.

00:42:26.585 --> 00:42:27.586
Wait.

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:32.925
Can you leave me a message?

00:42:33.008 --> 00:42:36.428
I think I'll want to hear your voice.

00:42:37.012 --> 00:42:37.846
Well…

00:42:38.639 --> 00:42:39.598
I'll think about it.

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:43.727
I'll go now, then. What?

00:42:47.398 --> 00:42:48.315
You know,

00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:51.443
do you think
they'll call and sign the deal?

00:42:51.527 --> 00:42:52.570
Of course.

00:42:53.362 --> 00:42:55.781
And you did such a great job today.

00:42:56.824 --> 00:42:57.825
I'm not sure.

00:42:58.409 --> 00:43:01.370
-I feel too uneasy.
-It's all right.

00:43:02.454 --> 00:43:03.831
This is just our beginning.

00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:07.626
-You're right.
-Oh, my.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:11.547
She's smiling. Does she like Tae-poong?

00:43:12.464 --> 00:43:14.508
Wait. I know that voice.

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:31.108
Right. I had a present for you.
I almost forgot.

00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:33.360
-Let me get it.
-A present?

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:36.196
It better not be
something like paper cranes.

00:43:40.576 --> 00:43:44.496
I made 999 cranes,
and you have to make the last one.

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.332
That way, your wish will come true.

00:43:48.375 --> 00:43:50.544
My wish is to marry someone rich.

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.130
Sure. Make a wish and let me know.

00:43:53.881 --> 00:43:56.175
I can be the man you want.

00:44:04.391 --> 00:44:05.559
Don't bring this

00:44:07.061 --> 00:44:08.270
when you come next time.

00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:15.903
What are you doing? Oh, my.

00:44:23.786 --> 00:44:24.828
See you tomorrow.

00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:29.375
Okay. See you tomorrow.
And the day after that!

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:32.044
And next week and next year!

00:44:32.127 --> 00:44:33.420
Let's keep seeing each other!

00:44:34.213 --> 00:44:35.214
Good night!

00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:39.760
What's going on?

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:42.596
-Is this a special day?
-It's not a special day.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.598
I just made some side dishes. That's all.

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:46.975
-Eat up.
-Goodness.

00:44:50.729 --> 00:44:51.689
Wait.

00:44:52.773 --> 00:44:55.109
-What happened to your hands?
-Oh, nothing.

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:58.946
I'm just not used to doing chores at home.

00:45:02.241 --> 00:45:04.326
Even if that's the case, how…

00:45:08.205 --> 00:45:09.206
It's good.

00:45:10.582 --> 00:45:12.793
-Be careful.
-Eat up, okay?

00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:14.461
It's good, so eat up.

00:45:17.256 --> 00:45:20.634
Eat up, Beom. Take a big bite.

00:45:20.717 --> 00:45:24.304
-You should eat, Mom. He's doing fine.
-I'm eating too.

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:25.431
Here.

00:45:29.768 --> 00:45:31.228
I'm a pretty good cook.

00:45:32.646 --> 00:45:34.898
-Eat up.
-Okay.

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:42.239
EXPORT TO EUROPE

LIST OF COMPANIES

00:46:06.472 --> 00:46:08.390
Hey, something's coming.

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:14.521
-"Ecnarf…"
-To France.

00:46:15.189 --> 00:46:17.816
-Right. To France?
-France.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.359
What's this?

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:22.070
-It's for foot volleyball.
-Jeez.

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:30.704
-It's this one, Mr. Kang.
-Right.

00:46:35.167 --> 00:46:36.919
Hello, you've reached Typhoon Trading.

00:46:54.603 --> 00:46:57.147
Yes, thank you! Goodbye!

00:46:58.065 --> 00:46:59.900
What did they say?

00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:01.485
I think we got a deal.

00:47:01.568 --> 00:47:03.153
-We did?
-We got it! My gosh!

00:47:03.237 --> 00:47:05.614
-We did?
-Yes, we got it!

00:47:05.697 --> 00:47:08.367
I don't know how!
My heart is racing so fast!

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:10.494
-Yes!
-We got it!

00:47:10.577 --> 00:47:12.120
My gosh. We did it!

00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:50.033
Dad, I sold something for the first time.

00:47:52.077 --> 00:47:54.955
Why does this feel so good?

00:48:18.186 --> 00:48:19.313
Worthwhile…

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:25.527
SHARING GOOD NEWS

00:48:38.832 --> 00:48:39.833
Worthwhile.

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:50.761
Mr. Researcher.

00:48:59.394 --> 00:49:00.729
Some snacks for you.

00:49:06.193 --> 00:49:07.444
Thanks.

00:49:11.907 --> 00:49:12.991
Goodbye, then.

00:49:38.767 --> 00:49:41.269
TYPHOON TRADING

00:49:41.853 --> 00:49:43.897
These are the documents
for export permits,

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.774
so give it
to the shipping company or whatever.

00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:47.776
Okay, then.

00:49:47.859 --> 00:49:49.611
These will leave in two days?

00:49:49.695 --> 00:49:52.280
I don't even work here,
so you can't make me work.

00:49:52.364 --> 00:49:53.615
Five hours of time online.

00:49:57.077 --> 00:49:58.954
Let me know after you file it by 6:00 p.m.

00:49:59.037 --> 00:50:01.206
-I'll page you if any problem arises.
-Okay.

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:04.710
I'll be there after inspecting
the 2,000 pairs in the Hwaseong factory.

00:50:04.793 --> 00:50:07.629
-Was it Hongshin Company?
-Yes, she's throwing a party.

00:50:07.713 --> 00:50:09.297
Do you want to join us, Mr. Bae?

00:50:09.381 --> 00:50:11.717
No, I also have a crazy party to attend.

00:50:12.592 --> 00:50:14.261
-See you tonight.
-See you.

00:50:17.264 --> 00:50:20.809
-Are you starting now?
-Yes, please check the time.

00:50:22.644 --> 00:50:25.272
It was five hours.
You have until 1:10 p.m.

00:50:25.355 --> 00:50:27.190
Let's drop ten minutes
and start at 8:00 a.m.

00:50:44.833 --> 00:50:45.751
What?

00:50:46.835 --> 00:50:48.962
What do you mean,
you can't load our shoes now?

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:50.756
Are you kidding me?

00:50:50.839 --> 00:50:54.426
-Where's Tae-poong now?
-He went straight to the shipping company.

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:57.512
This is driving me crazy.

00:50:59.473 --> 00:51:02.642
What do you mean the shipping company
canceled the shipment?

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:07.522
What? Typhoon Trading is on a blacklist?

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:09.649
Have you lost your mind?

00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:11.651
ANNOUNCEMENT: SHIPPING BLACKLIST

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:15.655
-Why are we blacklisted?
-I don't know the reason.

00:51:16.198 --> 00:51:20.577
These are to leave in two days.
You can't just cancel it like this.

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:24.039
We just received an order,
so we don't have a choice.

00:51:24.122 --> 00:51:27.417
We won't have enough time
to find a new shipping company.

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:30.504
Can you please help us out?
I'm begging you.

00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:35.550
There's no use in doing this.
I can't help you. I don't have any power.

00:51:36.343 --> 00:51:37.427
Who's this punk?

00:51:37.511 --> 00:51:39.304
-Hello, sir.
-Why is this fraud here?

00:51:41.556 --> 00:51:42.891
What's going on?

00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:44.392
Mr. Vice CEO.

00:51:44.476 --> 00:51:47.145
Do you remember Typhoon Trading
I mentioned earlier?

00:51:47.229 --> 00:51:49.189
He's the guy.

00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:51.274
Last time, he scammed us
with the quantity,

00:51:51.358 --> 00:51:55.654
and this time,
he even stole products from loan sharks.

00:51:55.737 --> 00:51:57.155
No, sir.

00:51:57.239 --> 00:52:01.159
I'm not sure what you heard from him,
but we didn't do that.

00:52:01.243 --> 00:52:03.954
Please let us load the products
as you have promised,

00:52:04.037 --> 00:52:05.997
and then we can undo the misunderstanding.

00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:08.375
Why don't we head
to the raw fish restaurant?

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:10.418
I made a reservation
at a phenomenal place.

00:52:10.502 --> 00:52:13.880
It won't do your ears any good
to hear out a sham like him.

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:16.842
Mr. Vice CEO,
please hear me out just once.

00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:20.554
I would've been in big trouble
if it hadn't been for you, Mr. Pyo.

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:22.222
Where's the restaurant again?

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:23.765
-Let me lead the way.
-Goodbye, sir!

00:52:24.933 --> 00:52:26.893
-Let's go, sir.
-Where is it?

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:27.894
Goodbye, sir.

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:30.981
Will you leave now? Goodness gracious.

00:52:32.858 --> 00:52:35.819
You also know the punk
at Pyo Merchant Marine, right?

00:52:35.902 --> 00:52:37.612
He's just no good.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.155
Yes.

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:44.619
I talked to Ms. Oh.

00:52:45.161 --> 00:52:47.622
But it looks like
there's no way around this.

00:52:48.623 --> 00:52:51.418
I looked up ways to ship it via plane,
but that'll cost much more.

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:54.588
I can't believe these jerks
stopped you from shipping these out!

00:52:57.173 --> 00:52:59.467
Where are you going? Hey!

00:52:59.551 --> 00:53:01.303
Where are you going, Tae-poong?

00:53:01.386 --> 00:53:03.889
What's he going to do?
What will he do with these?

00:53:14.816 --> 00:53:16.985
This is fun.

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.908
Jeez. That startled me.

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:46.848
What an idiot.

00:54:01.112 --> 00:54:03.865
What do you think?
It's stronger than your head, isn't it?

00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:06.868
I really love these.

00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:12.207
You crazy punk.

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:14.334
Didn't you know I was crazy?

00:54:15.794 --> 00:54:17.921
You know how people would come out on TV

00:54:18.004 --> 00:54:21.508
and say things like, "This work
or this product is like my child"?

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:23.343
I never knew what that meant.

00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:27.138
But these feel that way to me.

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:31.768
It's the first ever product I've sold.

00:54:33.728 --> 00:54:35.814
They feel like my own children.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.026
So what, you punk?

00:54:44.823 --> 00:54:46.616
Do whatever else you can.

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:49.869
But the next time,

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:52.455
what breaks won't be this window.

00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:55.333
It'll be

00:54:56.835 --> 00:54:58.003
right up here.

00:55:01.673 --> 00:55:03.091
And Jeon Sa-dok loses.

00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:06.886
Let's go, my baby.

00:55:14.185 --> 00:55:15.311
Jeon Sa-dok loses?

00:55:21.943 --> 00:55:23.319
Darn it!

00:55:26.114 --> 00:55:29.200
This is bad.
Those should've been loaded by now.

00:55:30.368 --> 00:55:33.204
Even if we find another company,
Pyo won't let it happen.

00:55:33.913 --> 00:55:36.166
Mr. Park will be devastated
if he finds out.

00:55:37.459 --> 00:55:39.753
So what's your plan?

00:55:48.303 --> 00:55:50.180
Of course…

00:55:52.807 --> 00:55:53.892
I do have a plan.

00:55:53.975 --> 00:55:55.185
What's with you?

00:55:55.977 --> 00:55:57.896
Why do you seem so off?

00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:07.405
This isn't water! It's alcohol!

00:56:07.489 --> 00:56:08.698
Hey, this is alcohol!

00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:10.241
What are you talking about?

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:12.619
Oh, my.

00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:14.996
Hey, I left alcohol in there
to wash tripe.

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.456
How did it end up there?

00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:19.918
You know, I always have a plan.

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:25.215
Now, listen.

00:56:26.674 --> 00:56:30.428
I'll take the shoes and tie everything up.

00:56:30.512 --> 00:56:32.013
-Tie them up?
-Tie them up.

00:56:32.597 --> 00:56:36.601
Then I'll put them on my huge shoulders.

00:56:36.684 --> 00:56:37.936
-I'll do that.
-Okay.

00:56:38.019 --> 00:56:41.898
I'll swim freestyle or breaststroke

00:56:42.857 --> 00:56:44.567
to cross the Pacific.

00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:47.737
Then I'll do the backstroke
to cross the Atlantic.

00:56:48.321 --> 00:56:49.614
My goodness!

00:56:53.868 --> 00:57:00.333
I was a former swimmer
at the YWCY baby sports team.

00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:08.800
You held out for a while.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.773
Jeez!

00:57:23.857 --> 00:57:25.608
Use your legs a little, you punk.

00:57:29.821 --> 00:57:32.699
When did you get here, Mr. Park?

00:57:35.243 --> 00:57:36.327
Did you hear the news?

00:57:40.373 --> 00:57:41.416
What can he do?

00:57:42.167 --> 00:57:45.044
-He did his best.
-Let's go.

00:57:46.379 --> 00:57:48.423
-Ms. Jung.
-Yes?

00:57:49.048 --> 00:57:51.885
How long does it take
to get to Wando Island from here?

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:53.595
Wando Island? Why?

00:57:55.221 --> 00:57:57.056
We should save this young man.

00:58:00.602 --> 00:58:02.896
I'm telling you, use your legs!

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:03.938
We're almost there.

00:58:04.439 --> 00:58:06.357
-Where?
-Pull yourself together!

00:58:06.441 --> 00:58:07.734
I've walked for too long.

00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:09.652
Gosh.

00:58:09.736 --> 00:58:11.029
The lights are on.

00:58:11.112 --> 00:58:13.406
Is Bo-ram still up waiting for you?

00:58:14.115 --> 00:58:17.827
Thank you
for showing concern for Bo-ram too.

00:58:19.078 --> 00:58:20.747
Bo-ram!

00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:24.876
Wait.

00:58:24.959 --> 00:58:28.463
-Sir, why are you doing this?
-Why didn't you come sooner, you idiot?

00:58:28.546 --> 00:58:29.422
What are you doing?

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:31.174
You're late.

00:58:31.966 --> 00:58:32.967
Don't touch her.

00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:36.554
-She'll wake up.
-Do you like kids?

00:58:38.431 --> 00:58:39.474
I don't.

00:58:39.557 --> 00:58:42.435
Hey, how dare you come here?

00:58:42.519 --> 00:58:43.478
Ms. Jung.

00:58:44.229 --> 00:58:45.647
Am I not allowed to be here?

00:58:46.606 --> 00:58:48.066
I like it here.

00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:54.155
So you couldn't load your stuff?

00:58:58.910 --> 00:59:00.286
What about my money?

00:59:06.167 --> 00:59:07.252
Have you been tailing me?

00:59:07.335 --> 00:59:09.212
I know everything
that's happening in Pusan.

00:59:13.299 --> 00:59:14.300
You know what I like?

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:18.471
Those sparkly eyes of yours.

00:59:20.098 --> 00:59:21.474
They seem so familiar.

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:25.687
Was it here?

00:59:28.189 --> 00:59:29.732
They'll be mine in a month.

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:34.445
Keep them safe.

00:59:38.449 --> 00:59:39.993
What's he talking about?

00:59:41.119 --> 00:59:42.078
Ms. Oh.

00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:44.289
Who's she?

00:59:44.914 --> 00:59:46.833
I am Senior Staff Oh Mi-seon
of Typhoon Trading.

00:59:50.044 --> 00:59:51.087
Is the girl yours?

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:54.382
May I ask you to elaborate
on what you just said?

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:11.399
DEBT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM
COLLATERAL: TWO EYEBALLS

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:25.455
And you're serious?

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:28.916
I never tell jokes.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:33.921
Okay.

01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:38.217
Ms. Oh.

01:00:43.848 --> 01:00:44.807
Ms. Oh.

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:48.353
Wait up, Ms. Oh.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:54.859
-Where are you going at this hour?
-To Seoul. I'll find a way.

01:00:55.735 --> 01:00:56.986
I'm sorry. I can explain.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:59.238
-I was going to tell you, but--
-Mr. Kang.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:01.699
Are you serious?

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:03.993
What do you mean?

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:07.789
Do you think everything we're doing
and have done is a joke?

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:11.751
Are you saying the work I did was a joke?

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.002
It wasn't?

01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:19.217
Then what were you thinking
when you signed that form?

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:22.553
-Did it make any sense to you?
-I get what you mean.

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:26.182
But Mr. Park was in real danger!

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:34.190
So what?

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.861
Did you pity him?
Did you want to help him and look cool?

01:01:39.737 --> 01:01:41.656
All right. Everything's great.

01:01:41.739 --> 01:01:44.200
But you should've done that personally.

01:01:44.283 --> 01:01:46.953
You went there to find our product
as the CEO of Typhoon Trading!

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:49.080
And what? Did you go there to play a hero?

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:53.876
Play a hero?

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.130
If you're going to be emotional,
there's no point to doing all this.

01:01:58.005 --> 01:01:58.881
No.

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:01.592
It's not just about money.

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:05.138
What was it like after Mr. Kang passed?
How could you sign yourself away again?

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:07.849
Then Typhoon Trading and I
would've lost the CEO twice.

01:02:07.932 --> 01:02:09.767
Has it crossed your mind? Was it so easy?

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:13.646
How am I going to trust
a CEO like that and continue to work here?

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:18.151
We're not a rescue organization.

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.069
We're a trading company!

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:25.032
You have no idea
what's the most important to us.

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:38.212
What do you think
is the most important to us?

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:40.423
We're a trading company,
so it's making money,

01:02:40.506 --> 01:02:43.342
paying off debts, and saving our business.

01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:50.224
My mom keeps making me bulgogi,
although I don't bring her a penny.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.561
Everything you said was right.

01:02:53.644 --> 01:02:55.313
I'm not good enough,

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:57.982
and I'm too emotional.

01:02:58.065 --> 01:03:00.276
But I've never considered this a joke.

01:03:02.987 --> 01:03:03.821
Actually…

01:03:08.242 --> 01:03:11.412
Actually, it's difficult and scary.

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:12.413
But, Ms. Oh,

01:03:13.247 --> 01:03:14.999
no matter how hard and scary it is,

01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:18.836
we can't turn a blind eye to someone

01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:22.465
who's dying before us
and begging for help.

01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:29.388
I'm sorry for not giving you enough faith.

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:33.768
But I'll always make the same choice.

01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:37.605
I can't help it.

01:03:39.273 --> 01:03:40.274
This is who I am.

01:03:51.118 --> 01:03:52.328
Let's go back to Seoul.

01:04:22.066 --> 01:04:23.734
Do you know where you're going?

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.739
I don't know anything.

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:32.201
I don't even know what's important.

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:39.750
If I say
we should walk over to the lights,

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:42.503
will you think that's too emotional?

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.090
You're holding grudges now?

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:51.429
-What now?
-Just come.

01:05:05.943 --> 01:05:08.112
CAUTION: SLIPPERY FLOOR
WEAR ANTI-SLIP BOOTS

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:14.410
Look who it is. Aren't you two from Seoul?

01:05:14.493 --> 01:05:16.621
-Hello.
-Hey, there.

01:05:17.204 --> 01:05:19.081
What brings you here in the dead of night?

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:20.583
No reason.

01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:24.003
Did you two fight?

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:25.588
-No.
-Yes.

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:28.466
-You're right.
-How adorable.

01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:29.592
No, we're not.

01:05:30.843 --> 01:05:31.969
Look at you two.

01:05:32.553 --> 01:05:34.805
What's this fish?

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:37.934
These are mackerels,
and these are horse mackerels.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:40.478
Hey, Captain!

01:05:40.561 --> 01:05:42.146
Great work today.

01:05:42.229 --> 01:05:44.941
The horse mackerels are quite fresh.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.196
Captain, where do these come from?

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:52.531
You wouldn't know where in the vast sea.

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:55.368
It's the sea near our country.

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:59.622
But they must've swam here
from quite a distance,

01:06:00.414 --> 01:06:02.041
somewhere in the Pacific.

01:06:04.001 --> 01:06:07.588
Hey, Jeong-gun! Come on.

01:06:13.886 --> 01:06:16.514
Excuse me, Captain.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:22.395
By the way, how far can this boat go?
Can it reach Mexico?

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:24.480
-Mexico?
-Yes.

01:06:24.563 --> 01:06:27.608
If it ends up in Mexico,
it'll be a shipwreck.

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:33.197
But there are fishing boats
that travel to South America.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.076
You'll find
deep-sea fishing vessels over there.

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:38.995
They don't just go to South America.

01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:42.748
They go to Alaska, Europe,
and all around the globe.

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:45.418
Why?

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:49.046
-Do you want to get on one?
-No, not us.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.715
Just forget it.

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:53.676
Once onboard,
you're out there for two years minimum.

01:06:53.759 --> 01:06:58.097
By any chance,
do you know where I can find such a ship?

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:01.350
That must be it.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:05.312
FV IMAGIN

01:07:08.649 --> 01:07:11.569
Hi, is the captain here?

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:15.322
Captain! Sir!

01:07:15.906 --> 01:07:17.074
What do you want?

01:07:17.158 --> 01:07:19.118
Hello.

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:21.495
My name is Kang Tae-poong
of Typhoon Trading.

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:25.958
We wanted to ask you for a favor, sir.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:30.379
Do you load different items on your ship,
such as shoes?

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.132
We have 5,000 safety shoes
that have to go.

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.303
Can you ship them to Mexico?

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:44.560
Did he just say yes?

01:07:44.643 --> 01:07:46.562
-I think so.
-Right?

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:48.147
Boys.

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:50.024
-Did it work?
-I think so.

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:55.571
What? Why?

01:07:55.654 --> 01:07:56.781
-Goodness!
-What is it?

01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:58.949
-Wait! Why?
-Why?

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:09.543
THE LEGEND OF AMBITION

01:08:42.159 --> 01:08:44.578
TYPHOON FAMILY

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:47.039
Why do you make me worried sick?

01:08:47.123 --> 01:08:48.040
You punk!

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.625
Do you know how much damage you caused?

01:08:49.708 --> 01:08:53.003
Do you have what it takes
to take Kang Tae-poong down?

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:54.338
What are you doing?

01:08:54.421 --> 01:08:57.633
I want to sell this,
but I don't know where to begin.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:00.136
We'll start exporting to Thailand now.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:04.890
I didn't think it seemed right
for Ms. Oh Mi-seon to be in sales.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.309
But Ms. Oh is Typhoon Trading's trader.

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:09.228
And when you smile, you're beautiful.

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:11.272
I think I like you.
