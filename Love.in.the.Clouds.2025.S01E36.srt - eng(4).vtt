and all lives of the Six Realms

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.540
need us to seal the Sky-Swallowing Array.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.780
Who are you?

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.660
I am the ruler of the netherbeast army from Cangwu Hill.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.450
I've finally found someone

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.010
who is truly willing to sacrifice for the Six Realms.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.410
You are the Spiritual Veins Fairy

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.980
who caused the Netherbeast Calamity a hundred years ago.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.810
Yes.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.340
I used a spell to hide the last trace of my divine consciousness

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.930
inside this Sky-Swallowing Array.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.490
I have long waited for someone from a later time to meet me here.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.730
Fairy Lin,

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.610
what exactly happened back then?

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.170
The Netherbeast Calamity a century ago

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.580
was not my doing.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.580
Let me tell you the truth.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.050
A hundred years ago,

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.580
the Emperor of Zhushui bred netherbeasts

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.170
to rule over the Six Realms.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.540
But he knew that refining them

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.140
would damage his primordial spirit.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.250
Hence, he used love as bait

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.460
and tricked me into raising the netherbeasts

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.660
at Cangwu Hill.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.140
When I discovered his plot to destroy the world,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.780
I tried to stop him, and failed.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.980
He ended up imprisoning me.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.660
While I was imprisoned, the Emperor of Zhushui

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.020
released the netherbeasts to wreak havoc.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.370
Countless lives across the Six Realms perished

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.980
and war spread once again.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.900
To the outside world,

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.220
he pretended to have destroyed the netherbeasts

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.540
and acted like a savior.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.020
To truly end the disaster,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.290
I had to trick him

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.700
into performing the Heartbond Array with me

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.220
to subdue the netherbeasts.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.140
But he had planned ahead.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.900
He used me as a tribute

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.980
and forged the ancient forbidden spell,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.220
the Sky-Swallowing Array.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.610
He set the Sky-Swallowing Array

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.020
inside the Zhuojin Tower.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.850
He planned to activate it during the Qingyun Tournament,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.100
to seize the source of spiritual power from the Nine Heavens,

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.140
and consume all the Blessed Rain

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.140
so he could control the Six Realms.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.700
The Sky-Swallowing Array must be cultivated for a century.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.490
It required someone from the Bo clan

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.780
who possessed the special spiritual veins

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.170
born from Heavenly Grief and the Golden Millet Dream

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.700
to truly unlock it.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.580
You had already passed away,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.660
but with your spiritual power

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.730
you sealed the last of your divine consciousness

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.660
inside the Sky-Swallowing Array,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.780
all to stop the Emperor of Zhushui.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.370
Correct.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.370
Only those who are willing to sacrifice themselves

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.050
and offer their lives as tribute

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.490
can see me.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.050
Only then do we have a chance to save the Six Realms of Hexu.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.250
Fairy Lin,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.980
did you know the Emperor of Zhushui

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.100
blamed everything on you?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.980
He claimed that you raised netherbeasts and brought chaos.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.250
Every Spiritual Veins Fairy after you

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.580
was seen as a bad omen.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.540
I never imagined

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.020
that I would become

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.850
the excuse to condemn the fairies of the future.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.810
How ridiculous.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.540
To seal the Sky-Swallowing Array,

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.370
someone at the Transcendent Stage

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.660
must die to destroy it.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.980
You are both at the Transcendent Stage.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.730
Luckily, you entered the array together.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.580
Your divine consciousness is connected,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.490
and, most importantly, your hearts are in sync.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.730
You trust each other.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.410
I have a plan.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.050
With the last of my spiritual power,

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.140
I can merge your spiritual veins.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.930
That will grant you the strength of the Perfected Stage.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.810
You may escape safely and destroy

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.170
the Sky-Swallowing Array.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.810
You must protect the Six Realms

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.540
and change everything.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.170
We will not fail you.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.490
The Six Realms

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.540
will finally have the justice they deserve.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.220
The peace of the Six Realms

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.530
will be in your hands now, younglings.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.250
Ming Yi, you're alive!

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.700
What have you done?

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:20.580
Chao Yuan.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.980
Everything the Zhushui Spiritual State has done

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.460
must come to an end today.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.130
Impossible.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.980
None of you will ever defeat me.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.370
No one in this world

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.980
will ever surpass me again!

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.130
My loyal soul shall live and die with you.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.890
My loyal soul shall live and die with you.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.460
Bear witness! We guard the Primordial Realm.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.460
What is happening?

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.580
No idea.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.730
Wake up!

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.130
What's going on?

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.700
Ming Yi.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.530
I remember now.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.770
My life has never had any real worth.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.770
But back then,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.980
I met you.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.300
Do you think I could ever be like you?

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.940
My whole life feels like a joke.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:33.650
Ming Yi.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.060
Do you still remember our promise?

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.890
Immortal Situ.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.180
In the end, I was the one who owed you.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.650
Ming Yi, promise me one thing.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.460
I haven't decided yet.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.130
But whatever it is I ask for,

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.370
you'll make it happen for me, won't you?

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.580
Right?

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.250
I've decided.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.340
In the next life,

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.420
let's meet again and start over.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.460
I hope that in your next life, you'll live for yourself.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.100
The Emperor of Zhushui, Chao Heng, and Crown Prince Chao Yuan

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.060
attempted to control the Six Realms during the Qingyun Tournament

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.700
by manipulating the Sky-Swallowing Array.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.010
Their crimes were unforgivable.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.100
Both have met their end.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.300
This announcement is made to Hexu to set the record straight.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.980
[Chao Heng of Zhushui Spiritual State]

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.730
The Sunken Abyss is gone.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.300
We stopped Zhushui Spiritual State's plot.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.340
As for Chao Heng,

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:45.420
he was overthrown by the traitors.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.060
In future Qingyun Tournaments,

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.530
the title of the top warrior of the Six Realms

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.730
will be decided with only fairness.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.100
From now on, the Six Realms' Blessed Rain will be shared equally

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.130
between the Upper and Lower Realms.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:59.730
Fairy Bo.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.940
The truth is, the debt between us can never really be settled.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.290
But I do know that

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.810
when you first came to find me,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.770
you truly wanted to save me.

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.380
And I also know

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.860
that you taught me with everything you had.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.050
You protected me with your own life,

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.420
so I could cure the poison,

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.810
and live safely until today,

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.730
and see for myself

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.380
what this world is really like.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.180
So, you see,

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.090
I have no right to hate you.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.050
Whether you did it to atone for your sins,

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.660
or out of kindness and loyalty,

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.250
either way,

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.860
I could never repay you.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:55.620
From this moment on,

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.570
you may rest in peace.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.770
Under the proposal of Empress Tianji of Jixing Abyss,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.810
the rulers of all realms reached a joint decision.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.620
From now on, the Qingyun Tournament

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.050
will have only one final round.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.460
The tests of spiritual power will end once a clear result is shown.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.050
No matter the outcome,

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.900
all Six Realms will share the Blessed Rain of the Nine Heavens.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.140
- Great! - Wonderful!

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.460
That's wonderful.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.660
Come on, tell us about Ming Yi and Ji Bozai.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.250
Is he still a warrior of Jixing Abyss?

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.220
The final match was interrupted.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:42.980
The rematch is next month.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.860
Does that mean Ming Yi

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.420
will face Ji Bozai once more?

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.530
- Exactly. - That's right.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.490
That Ji Bozai really is something.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.010
He's carefree and reckless, as always.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.700
When the Emperor of Yaoguang asked what his future plans were,

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.900
he said he only wanted

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.460
to remain a warrior in the warrior ranks.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.620
The Emperor of Yaoguang was furious about it, of course.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.490
But Ji Bozai told him,

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.090
"Your Majesty,

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.770
you're still in your prime.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.900
You could always raise another crown prince."

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.980
That's exactly what Ji Bozai would say.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.180
Only he could come up

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:21.380
with something like that.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.730
You're telling me.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:23.940
- Exactly. - Totally.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.180
So, he is living on Yaoguang Mountain,

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.420
apart from Ming Yi

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.770
who is now at Jixing Abyss?

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.140
Ji Bozai still has the Spirit Well.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:33.940
That's right.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.180
He can bend space itself.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.900
So meeting up isn't a problem at all.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.900
Those two really are quite the pair.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.900
They can fall in love one moment,

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.660
then fight side by side the next.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.940
They manage to do both without missing a beat.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.380
Exactly.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.860
I really do wonder

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.420
which of the two of them

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:55.900
is the strongest in all Six Realms.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.460
We'll find out next month.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.530
I can't wait to see who will actually win.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.770
Speaking of Ming Yi,

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.010
her spiritual veins are said to be the purest and strongest of all.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.250
It's simply peerless.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.770
Why did you catch so few fish?

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.940
Next time you go fishing, take me along.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.050
By the way,

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.290
where did you catch them?

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.010
They taste amazing once they're dried.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.770
You never stop eating or talking.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:16.490
Shut it.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.730
I was trapped inside that bell for so long,

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.900
I couldn't even eat a single dried fish.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.530
Now I just want to make it up to myself, what's wrong with that?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.570
I'll catch you a whole bucket tomorrow.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.180
Are you coming with me?

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.380
Of course I am.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.530
The dried fish I eat

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.810
has to be handpicked by me.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:36.900
You'll just catch them for me.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.700
So, who do you think will win?

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.050
Ji Bozai or Ming Yi?

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.940
That's obvious...

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.810
Of course it's Ming Yi, right?

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:46.460
I...

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.980
I told you so.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.730
Think about it.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.010
Ming Yi has defeated every opponent across the Six Realms.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.570
If it weren't for the Heavenly Grief,

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.420
she would have won.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.330
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.420
His Lordship's spiritual veins have recovered.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.090
He also has the Spirit Well.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.220
What about the Spirit Well?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.290
Is it really that powerful?

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.290
Can it surpass Ming Yi's extraordinary veins?

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.730
Besides, she has that unbeatable companion beast, Twenty-Seven.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.730
Then, stop eating your dried fish.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.860
Fine, I won't.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.530
Their strength is evenly matched, though.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.010
Ming Yi will win for sure.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.180
No, His Lordship will.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.660
Ming Yi will win.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.290
His Lordship will win.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.900
Ming Yi will win.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.620
His Lordship will win.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.010
Ming Yi will win!

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.900
Ladies, if there's any jewelry you like, just tell me.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.140
I'll knock a few spirit stones off the price today.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.050
Come and have a look!

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.180
Oh my!

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.090
You're having twins!

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.570
Can you please be more careful?

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:43.490
It's fine.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.660
You've gone from running a stall to owning a shop.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.140
You're earning even more Blessed Rain now,

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.660
but that doesn't mean you should get too excited.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.090
I'm not that fragile.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.620
Empress Tianji has issued a decree.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.940
Even non-warriors can enter the Outer Realm.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.220
Ming Yi, Ji Bozai,

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:55.980
Zheng Tiao, and I,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.330
can travel freely now.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.770
Of course I'm happy about it.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:00.940
My love.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:02.620
I missed you.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.810
I missed you too.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.940
I'll get back to work.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.140
Take your time.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.050
Ming Yi told me

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.770
to keep tomorrow free.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.810
She probably has something planned.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:22.980
I heard that

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.620
Immortal Ji proposed to Fairy Ming Yi several times,

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.460
but she turned him down.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:29.980
So what?

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.660
Ming Yi doesn't have to say yes

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.730
just because he proposed.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:34.700
If you ask me,

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.330
I wouldn't want to marry either.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.730
Marriage only ties people down.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:39.730
It makes them soft.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.250
How can you focus on your career that way?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.900
Your Majesty, don't worry.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.860
I'll do everything I can to assist you.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.220
I'll protect Jixing Abyss

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.770
and never let you waver even for a moment.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.940
You're surprisingly understanding.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:08.570
Well then…

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.050
Will you do so even without a name or a title?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.980
I think

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.010
that's fine with me.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.980
If that day truly comes,

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:34.730
when you become just one butterfly among millions,

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.050
no different from the rest,

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.810
I would still recognize you.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:56.770
This wine of yours is quite good.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:57.460
Fairy Ming Yi,

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.420
I brewed it for you with Blessing Flowers.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.090
Really?

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.010
You dare to steal my food?

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.140
Why are you fighting with a child?

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.330
Why are you fighting your brother?

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:06.980
Don't you have your own?

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.220
So unfair.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.050
How is that unfair?

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.330
Wine!

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.140
The cat can't drink that.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.810
Ming Yi.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.660
Zhang Tai!

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.860
No.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.090
Careful, the baby.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.700
I forgot.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.380
It's fine.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.050
Sorry.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:24.980
Happy birthday.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.460
You didn't have to bring a gift.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.700
Zhang Tai chose it carefully.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:29.530
Didn't you?

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:30.530
Come out quickly.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:31.700
Stop troubling your mother.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.490
Come play with your brother.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.460
I see now.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.090
So that's why you asked me to keep today free.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.490
It's your birthday.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.860
Empress.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.730
You only prepared one gift?

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.860
I'm not the only one celebrating today.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.010
Try it.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.490
But don't eat too much.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.860
I'll accept it on his behalf.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:59.660
Other than Master Ming Yi,

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.090
who else has a birthday today?

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.180
Chen Xi.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.530
You're not as quick-witted as I am now.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.250
Where is he?

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:08.460
Of course he's...

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.180
Immortal Ji, happy birthday.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.660
Don't move.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.810
- Immortal Ji, Fairy Ming Yi. - Immortal Ji, Fairy Ming Yi.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.770
- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:43.900
Happy birthday.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.250
Wishing you good health.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.140
Wait.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.620
What a lively crowd.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.010
You lot of rascals,

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.940
you're all behaving outrageously.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.140
How could you drink without inviting me?

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:00.490
Father.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.140
My precious daughter,

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.330
happy birthday.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.660
And happy birthday to you too.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.140
Originally,

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.700
I had arranged with Emperor Cangwu

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.810
to go teach the children to cultivate their spiritual power at his place.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.290
But when I received this invitation

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.460
saying it was your birthday banquet,

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.490
how could I miss it?

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.700
I changed my plans at once

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.730
and hurried here.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.490
Next month,

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.290
you two will return to

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.570
the finals' arena.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.050
You little devil, I'm telling you,

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.490
last year my daughter drew Heavenly Grief,

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:30.490
that doesn't count.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.290
This year you must really compete properly.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.220
I'll warn you first,

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.140
do not, because of personal feelings,

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.490
let him win.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.860
Master She is right.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.420
Don't go easy on me.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:46.090
Father.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:48.700
Men won't slow my sword-drawing speed.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.730
That's my precious daughter.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.180
She'll have you picking teeth off the ground.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.090
Someone wants to be my son-in-law?

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:03.220
But it's not that easy.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.940
You must pass my test.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:07.010
Father,

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.620
don't organize it, nobody will drink.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.940
Dare you?

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.570
If you dare, come with me.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.250
Come on.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.090
Don't.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:20.380
This one was brewed by Meng Yangqiu.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.090
Just humor him,

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:23.090
don't show off.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.730
Try it.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.380
It's delicious.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.220
Twenty-Seven.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.980
You've eaten so much and you still eat?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.180
You've taken mine twice.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.290
How did you get this drunk?

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.010
With my father's capacity for wine,

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.620
no one would've been able to crawl out.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:41.810
This way.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.530
So then,

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:43.980
he must've gone easy on you.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.140
How much did you drink?

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.090
About two jars?

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.250
I drank...

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:50.570
How many was that?

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.050
Slow down.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.010
No, don't lie here.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.770
Just a few more steps.

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:03.570
Come on.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.770
What do you mean?

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.250
A wall.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.140
A whole wall of wine?

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.490
A wall of wine, you two…

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:19.570
My father-in-law said he wanted to test my character.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.860
How could I possibly lose?

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.900
Of course I had to drink.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.770
You could've shown a bit of weakness, it wouldn't kill you.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.730
What is it?

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.940
This is outside, no, that's not good.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.940
Scallion pancake.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:04.290
This taste…

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.660
It was the Empress of Yaoguang who asked me to bring it to you.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.860
She also wanted me to tell you,

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:13.980
happy birthday.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.460
How is she?

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.220
She…

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.570
His Majesty has already...

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.860
already lifted her confinement.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:32.250
But she still doesn't dare to see you.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.980
In a few days,

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.140
I'll go see her.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.490
I've never seen you like this before.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.940
Could you be like this more often?

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.980
Like what?

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:05.220
Just show me this side of you sometimes.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.490
A little.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.250
That tickles.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.250
Ming Yi.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.700
Actually…

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.490
I…

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.380
I…

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.620
I still owe you an apology.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.730
I said,

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:39.250
I still owe you an apology.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.620
The Sky-Swallowing Array, right?

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.660
Indeed, you shouldn't have hidden it from me.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:46.730
So what do we do?

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.700
But I lied to you before as well.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.380
So I owe you an apology too.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.940
That makes us even.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.860
But we must promise never to deceive each other again.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.700
Never to deceive each other.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:11.980
What are you doing?

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:14.010
What... What are you doing?

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.730
I want to do this.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.660
What?

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:20.980
I want.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.250
You want to do this?

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.770
I like this.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.490
I like you.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.490
I've never told you before.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.220
I like you.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:43.530
I really, truly like you.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.220
I want to be with you,

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.700
forever and ever.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:52.620
I want to stay by your side forever and ever.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.010
Will you…

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.860
Will you never,

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:01.330
ever leave me?

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:06.250
All right.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:09.860
Really?

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:16.180
You... You've accepted my proposal?

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.380
Wait.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.090
That just now

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.290
was a proposal?

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.730
That's all it takes?

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:36.050
Then could we

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:38.330
rewrite our names together on the Marriage Stone?

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:49.220
I... I'm asking you.

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:51.770
I want to rewrite our names on the Marriage Stone...

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:56.900
Why won't you answer me?

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.620
I already have.

Do you think you can eavesdrop on His Lordship?

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:38.530
You know,

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.260
after the Qingyun Tournament ends,

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.130
you'll be traveling through the Six Realms.

Final great trial in life?

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.090
Makes sense.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:10.900
No peeking, kids.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.980
What are you two looking at here?

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.460

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.210
Go back quickly.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.260
Go back.

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.460
Still watching? What's there to see?

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.130
Go back.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.460
Hurry back.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.340
Let's go, Granny Xun.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:31.460
Let's go.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:31.980
Let's go.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.900
You little brats, I'll deal with you later.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.860
What exactly must we carve on the Marriage Stone

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.820
to make sure we aren't punished by the heavens?

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.860
Carve Ming Yi and Ming Xian?

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.010
That sounds too strange.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:04.490
I don't want you changing your name back to Ming Xian.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.570
I was jealous of that guy long enough.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.010
Then we can't carve Ji Bozai and Ming Yi again, can we?

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.740
Let me think.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.780
Maybe this time it'll work without any trouble.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.690
After all, the last time we came here,

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.210
we both held something back.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.690
Especially you.

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:27.650
You complete liar.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:31.650
Then let's try again.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.300
This time, I'll do the carving.

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.210
After all,

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:36.570
the Marriage Stone teaches couples this way.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.940
Even divine punishment should be taken in turns.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:42.260
Go ahead.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:52.010
I'm joking.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:53.300
I'll do it.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.740
- this old couple - this old couple

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.650
- on their renewed bond of love! - on their renewed bond of love!

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.530
So it really is true.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.860
See? I told you it would be like this.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.940
If back then you'd given me even a little more sincerity,

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:02.650
I wouldn't have had to face the lightning tribulation.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.210
Ji Bozai.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.690
I... I was only joking with you.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.260
I didn't mean it seriously.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.980
Are you really angry?

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.010
The names were just carved

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.650
and you're already...

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.130
All right, it's my fault, all right?

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:25.340
I'll apologise to you.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:27.530
Ji Bozai, I already...

Who do you think will win?

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.940
I think Ming Yi looks promising.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:56.820
I bet Ming Yi wins.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.690
I bet Ji Bozai wins.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.460
After all, she's won seven years in a row.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:00.690
The only time she lost

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.300
was because of Heavenly Grief.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:02.690
Right.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:03.570
I'm not so sure.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.490
I heard Ji Bozai has made a breakthrough lately.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.050
He's reached the Perfected Stage.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:08.740
Then we can win too.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.130
Ming Yi

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.690
has also reached the Perfected Stage.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.260
- Ji Bozai for sure. - He's incredible.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.170
No, Ming Yi will win for sure.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.170

please grant me your guidance.
