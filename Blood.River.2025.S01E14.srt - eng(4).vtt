[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.980
[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.980
[Episode 14]

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.380
Blood River kills anyone,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.330
doesn't it?

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.020
I'll put

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.290
the hardest man to kill

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.410
before you.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.240
No need to

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.060
rush your answer.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.100
Think it over and...

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.330
And?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.490
If you turn your head,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.540
will it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.570
fall off?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.100
Relax.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.290
I won't kill you.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.660
Su Muyu's life

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.890
is still in your hands.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.890
How could I kill you?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.010
Sir.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.980
Get lost now.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.220
Since Su Muyu

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.500
is your guest,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.940
make sure you serve him fine food.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.500
He can't take spicy food.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.570
Remember that.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.730
Sir,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.450
you looked like

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.010
you were going to kill him just now.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.380
Yes,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.540
I was.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.610
I almost couldn't hold back.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.060
Good thing you did.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.760
Let it be then.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.440
I hope

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.130
they can treat Muyu well.

[Xiao Ruofeng, Prince of Langya]

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.940
Your Highness, your Drifting Swan Goose and Swallow move

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.940
has improved again.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.340
It's a stealth art

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.850
taught by Mr. Li.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.260
Oh, that Mr. Li.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.780
Though Mr. Li

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.100
had led

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.610
the best academy for years,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.260
he'd always

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.820
had an unconventional spirit.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.890
Besides ordinary swordplay and martial art skills,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.890
he excelled in

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.980
mystic arts

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.730
and deceptive arrays.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.220
If he knew

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.610
I used this method

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.060
to slip past everyone and come drink here,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.660
I wonder

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.780
if he'd shake his head.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.700
Your Highness,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.980
what would you like to drink?

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.140
The usual?

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.370
The usual.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.140
Sure.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.540
If I hadn't followed him all this way,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.660
I'd never have found him.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.170
The Prince of Langya's drinking here?

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.610
Sir?

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.220
You startled me.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.490
My apologies.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.810
Drinking alone

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.370
at this hour,

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.340
without guards

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.370
or curious eyes around,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.850
that's rare.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.220
Even the finest liquor

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.980
turns bitter

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.050
when drunk in sorrow.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.780
Who are you?

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.980
Please clear

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.660
the guests outside.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.490
Go to my residence to see my butler

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.050
for compensation for today's loss.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.540
Yes, Your Highness.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.980
The new Patriarch of Blood River,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.700
Su Changhe.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.460
You're confident.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.700
Ambitions

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.020
must be great enough

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.370
to make one fight for them a whole lifetime.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.370
For killers like us,

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.100
the greatest ambition

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.900
is to kill the hardest man to kill.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.660
Interesting.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.900
That

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.370
deserves a toast.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.460
I didn't expect

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.580
the well-celebrated

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.050
Prince of Langya

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.580
to be drinking alone

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.100
in a tavern.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.540
You're lonely.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.020
I've followed you for a long time.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.700
You have no one around you.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.370
Today,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.730
you deliberately hid

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.000
from everyone.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.660
Because you wanted

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.660
to see

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.540
how Tianqi

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.610
or this world would turn out

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.900
without you.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.540
Will it remain the same?

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.370
Were all your choices

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.220
over the years

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.490
not worth it?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.930
If you weren't a killer,

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.900
I'd love

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.850
to have a drink with you.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.050
What a shame.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.410
The world can't go on

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.140
without you.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.700
In the light, the people look up to you.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.020
In the shadows,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.540
we're waiting for you.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.900
It's been a long time

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.660
since I've had a proper fight

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.050
in Tianqi City.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.070
You didn't draw your sword.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.630
Are you trying to stall?

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.810
I've forgotten how to draw my sword.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:14.660
Forgotten?

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.450
I once had a sword

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.570
called The World's Third.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.100
It was named after my master,

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.220
Mr. Li's sword

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.100
called The World's Second,

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.300
which meant,

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.980
"I'm the second in the world.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.540
Who dares claim first?"

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.850
Then your World's Third

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.420
must've been the greatest swordsmanship

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.450
after Mr. Li,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.180
who led the academy.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.450
I honestly should've switched with that brat

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.450
for this mission.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.260
But I can't perform that move.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.330
I remember

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.180
how joyous it was when I created it

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.180
and how heroic it was when I wielded the sword.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.180
But now,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.850
when I lift the sword,

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.450
it feels empty.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.090
The Haoque Sword

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.020
doesn't answer me.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.850
Haoque?

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.180
It's just a sword.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.180
A famed sword

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.690
has its own spirit.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:20.330
No.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:29.570
Your sword

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.020
may be grand enough to embrace everything,

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.660
but to me,

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.810
it's hollow and pale.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.210
Your sword aura

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.020
contains too much benevolence.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.670
It lacks

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.090
killing intent that can take someone down.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:43.660
I don't fear

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:45.260
a sword like that.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.330
Because in everyone's eyes,

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.420
this world has never had a place

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.610
for me.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.380
Your sword kills the human heart.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.970
It can suppress the wielder's urge.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.570
I'm different.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.930
When I draw my sword,

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.020
I draw to kill.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.380
True.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.660
No sword

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.660
can really

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.450
embrace the whole world, after all.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.850
Sir,

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.140
I can't stop her.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.660
[Li Xinyue, Guardian Azure Dragon]

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.260
Why are you drinking here alone?

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.780
Do you think

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.060
you're still that willful prince you once were?

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.060
Xinyue.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.180
The Four Guardians of Tianqi,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.850
Guardian Azure Dragon.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.690
I knew

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.260
Blood River coming to Tianqi

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.260
couldn't mean anything good.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.540
You're not like Su Muyu.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.180
Hanyi told me,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.660
if I see you, don't hesitate.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.930
Heart Sword Rain from Sword Heart Tomb.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.330
Your killing intent is more extreme than mine.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.930
Looks like

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.450
my Heart Sword Rain isn't fierce enough

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.450
to shut your mouth.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.020
Break.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.060
It's you.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.300
Yes.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:35.300
It's me.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.930
Even if you came, it wouldn't help.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.300
This is bad.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:49.730
It's been a long time,

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.210
Mr. Su Zhe.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.140
You have a good memory, Your Highness.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.300
You remember me.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.420
Death-Chasing Bell.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.810
Life-Seizing Rings.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.780
I wouldn't dare forget.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.450
I'm no longer part of Blood River.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.260
Spare our lives.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.660
What do you say?

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.300
Back then, when I was escorting the Marquis of Zhenxi,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.930
someone paid Blood River a hefty price

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:14.970
for my life.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.850
Even though Mr. Su Zhe

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.090
had the upper hand,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.450
he spared us.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.850
Xinyue,

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:25.900
please let Mr. Su leave.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.380
If we let them go,

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.420
it'll cause endless trouble.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.260
Must we fight?

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:35.380
Xinyue,

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.610
please let Mr. Su leave.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.970
Su Muyu can't cook,

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.810
but he's good at picking pastry.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.610
This is nice.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.660
I wonder

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.140
if the Shadow Sect treated him well.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.090
Did they feed him bran and scraps

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.610
like a prisoner?

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.450
What happened to them?

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.380
What's going on?

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:23.930
Save them first.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.500
We'll talk later.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.180
Both of them look like they're about to die.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:27.930
Who do I save first?

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.450
Save the Patriarch.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.610
I'm fine.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:32.380
No.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.210
I... I can still hold on.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.570
Not pretending this time?

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.570
It's not that.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.330
I almost died.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.930
I just played dead.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.570
When she saw I wasn't a threat,

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.930
she spared me.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.690
That's why I'm not badly hurt.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:49.810
Unlike the Patriarch.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.850
He was struck

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.970
by the sword rain.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.020
Shut up.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.730
Who did you run into?

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.850
This is terrifying.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.570
Guardian Azure Dragon of Tianqi,

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.090
the heir to Heart Sword.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.610
I'll try to stop the bleeding.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.380
Piece of work.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.730
I'm in bad shape.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.690
Why are you still insulting me, Miss Bai?

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.420
Apply this medicine

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.690
all over Su Changhe.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.730
Three times a day.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.540
Get more from me when you run out.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.090
This will do?

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.210
I'd say

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.210
it's a waste to use it on him.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.690
Spill it.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.260
What are you plotting this time?

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.540
You made yourself look so pitiful.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.850
It's frightening,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.730
but

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:54.930
there's no inner injury at all.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.300
You're putting on an act.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.260
I heard you failed to kill Prince of Langya.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.930
We were about to succeed,

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.380
but Li Xinyue, Guardian Azure Dragon, arrived suddenly.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.420
Why didn't you stop her?

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.500
I didn't know you'd strike

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.300
at Diaolou Cottage.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.060
Nonsense.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.330
Opportunities vanish in the blink of an eye.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.420
How could we possibly have time to inform you?

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:37.780
Besides,

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.930
the Shadow Sect has spies all over the city.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.900
We sent signals,

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.420
how did you not know?

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.660
Yet Li Xinyue got there before you.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.330
I'm telling you,

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.610
if our Patriarch dies,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.810
I'll lead the entire Blood River

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.660
to fight you to death.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.380
You're gravely injured now.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.090
Will there be another chance?

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.570
We missed this one.

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:06.460
Prince of Langya

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.130
will definitely increase his guards.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.020
It'll be much harder

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.500
to kill him a second time.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:13.130
Right.

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.570
In many cases,

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.570
you only get one chance.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.500
No.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.780
There still is.

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:25.610
What do you plan to do, Sir?

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.460
I'll gather all Blood River elites from the Three Families and enter Tianqi

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:30.890
to kill him.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.370
The Blood River elites enter Tianqi?

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.330
Believe me.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.370
No one will notice.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.170
By the time they do,

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.410
they'll already be dead.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.330
I've shown my sincerity.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:49.700
I hope Sect Leader Yi

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.740
will show his

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.890
by sending enough men

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.780
to help.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.410
All right.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.980
I see your plan.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.780
Even though Su Muyu

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.570
and you

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.410
are powerful,

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.810
once you enter the vast Tianqi City,

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.740
you're like a pebble

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.060
dropped into a pond.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.060
But if an army of demons

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.370
with swords

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.410
enters Tianqi,

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.170
it'll be like countless pebbles

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.460
thrown into the pond,

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.130
stirring up huge waves.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.980
Yi Bu won't refuse.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.570
He has no reason to.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.300
You're indeed

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.980
a piece of work.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:07.610
Sir,

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.130
I met with Su Changhe today.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.610
They planned an assassination

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.780
of Prince of Langya

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.570
and nearly succeeded.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.780
Nearly succeeded?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.610
So they yet to succeed?

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:29.810
Yes, sir.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:31.700
The mission failed,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.020
and Su Changhe is seriously injured.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.300
But at the same time,

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.780
he swore enmity against Prince of Langya.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:40.940
He asks to rally all Blood River elites

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.740
to enter Tianqi City.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.260
All Blood River elites?

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.170
If anything goes wrong,

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.410
Tianqi City will be plunged

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.460
into horrific chaos.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:57.980
Sir,

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.020
are you suggesting

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.850
we stop Su Changhe?

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.020
No.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.370
Give him the approval.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.650
As long as Su Muyu is under my control,

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.260
I bet he won't act recklessly.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.540
It seems Drunken Dream Bone

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.740
does more than strip one of their martial skills,

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.650
it also sends them

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.300
into a strange trance.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.570
I thought I was the only one in this prison.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.610
You must've been poisoned

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:52.300
and can't use your inner force, right?

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.650
Otherwise,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.090
you would've sensed

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:55.890
my presence a long time ago.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.300
Yes.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.850
I've been poisoned.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.370
What's your name?

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.260
I'm Su Muyu, sir.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.060
Su Muyu.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.220
That's a nice name.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.500
How should I address you, sir?

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.220
My surname is Zhuo.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.170
Zhuo?

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.810
Why are you imprisoned here?

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.780
Someone wanted to use me,

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.330
someone wanted to kill me,

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.540
someone wanted to save me,

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.300
and I ended up here.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.890
All because of what others wanted.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:39.780
What about you?

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:47.940
Yue'an,

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.020
live on.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.850
When you grow up, become a sword deity

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.300
and rebuild No-Sword City.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.060
Father.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:05.980
Take care.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.060
Father.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.220
Father.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.890
Father.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:23.940
Father.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:27.890
Father!

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.610
Father!

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.940
I'm seeking an answer.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.220
What answer?

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.650
Something I have to know.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.810
If it's something you must know,

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.460
why haven't you found it

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.130
after all these years?

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.540
Because

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.570
once I know the answer,

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.060
there's something I must do.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.170
Something I couldn't do

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.940
back then.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:14.890
Back then, you say?

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.090
I believe it won't be long before I can.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:18.810
But first,

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.300
you need to get out of here.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.300
It's said that in the Shadow Sect's prison,

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.850
people die,

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.570
no one ever leaves alive.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.370
My friend will come to save me.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:29.570
Someone from Blood River

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.330
actually call another person

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:32.610
a friend?

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.780
You're different.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.300
What if he never comes?

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:39.980
Then I'll take the chance

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:41.540
to rest.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.260
You don't seem wary of me at all.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.170
You're telling me everything.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.220
Because

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:49.740
your surname is Zhuo, sir.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.980
Just because of a surname?

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.300
Yes.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:56.460
Because my father's

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.090
surname is Zhuo.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.020
I know it's you.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:17.090
Father.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.570
Yue'an,

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.130
you don't seem surprised

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.020
to see me again.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.220
Drunken Dream Bone

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.170
sends one into a drunken dream.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.130
I'd already guessed as much.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.780
Even if all this is just an illusion,

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:34.270
I still can't help

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.700
but want to talk with you.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.650
Yue'an,

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.220
you've suffered

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.740
all these years.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:43.410
Father,

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.330
I'll find the one behind

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.130
the fall of No-Sword City

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:49.370
and restore

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.060
the honor that was once ours.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.540
How have you been all this time?

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.300
It must've been tough

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.780
coming this far alone.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:00.850
Not entirely.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.700
All these years,

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.740
I've had my friends by my side.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.850
Drunken Dream Bone

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.170
is acting up.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:26.060
Yue'an,

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.780
I've always believed

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:29.780
you'll bring No-Sword City

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.060
back into the martial world.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:32.700
But more than that,

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.370
knowing you've had friends by your side

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.260
all these years

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.570
brings my heart peace.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:42.170
Father.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.850
Something feels wrong here.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.610
It's barely night,

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.090
and there's not a soul on this street.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.810
Why are you smiling?

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:24.810
It's the Chinese New Year's Eve.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.130
Naturally, the streets are empty.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.260
Even the usually busiest vendors

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.370
have gone home.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.020
What's so surprising about that?

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:37.780
It's the Chinese New Year's Eve today?

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.780
Smells great.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.410
It really does.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:48.260
What's that?

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.300
It smells like fried tofu.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.220
It's a kind of dish

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.460
common folk make for the Chinese New Year.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.570
They use puffy tofu

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:57.980
and deep-fry it.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.020
For rich households,

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.810
they stuff them with meat.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:04.610
I want to try some.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.810
Go grab a few.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.500
Chinese New Year's Eve

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.510
is one of the few good days in the year

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.220
for the poor.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.370
Don't cause them trouble

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.540
on a day like this.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.090
Fine.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.090
Did you look forward to the Chinese New Year when you were a kid?

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.060
Of course.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:27.780
It was

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.260
one of the rare good days

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.220
of the year.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.170
No matter how many troubles

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.130
the past year brought,

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:36.890
when the new year began,

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:37.810
all those worries

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.330
seemed to disappear.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:42.330
Everyone

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:43.330
ate happily,

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.410
and when dawn broke,

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.090
everything started anew.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.650
You sound so bookish.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.330
I heard people say

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.090
they like the Chinese New Year

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.700
because it's the only time

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.980
they get to eat

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.410
what they usually can't afford.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.260
That's true for ordinary families.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.650
When I was a kid, we were quite well off.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.090
So I never really felt that way.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:11.610
I forgot

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.300
you were born

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.500
with a silver spoon.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:26.890
You've never celebrated the Chinese New Year?

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.740
As far back as I can remember,

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.570
my brother and I were always wandering.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.090
Later, we joined Blood River.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.500
There's no such thing

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.570
as a celebration there.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:42.300
So

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.810
I've never had one.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:54.810
It's a shame

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.260
no taverns are open today.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.220
Otherwise, I'd buy you a drink.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.020
Jeez.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.260
Who's there?

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.940
Don't be afraid, madam.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.500
We're just travelers passing through.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:15.810
We'll rest a while

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.020
and be on our way.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.040
It's the Chinese New Year.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.500
You're still traveling?

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.170
Yes.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.810
We had something to attend to

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.810
and got delayed.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:28.130
Changhe,

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:28.810
let's go.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:32.500
Sons.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.220
On Chinese New Year's Eve,

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.220
only inns in big cities

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.300
stay open.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.060
The nearest big city

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.020
is eight to ten hours away.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.170
Why don't you

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.810
come have dinner at my place?

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:53.780
Sons,

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:55.890
please.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.540
I beg you to keep an old woman company.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.370
Come have dinner.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:04.890
Alright.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.810
Come on.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:37.570
Have some tea.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:40.810
Have a seat.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.610
I'll make you a meal.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.300
Sit. Make yourselves at home.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.890
Aren't you worried it's a trap?

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.260
I'm not.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.570
Are you afraid?

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.220
How can it be?

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.460
Smells like fried tofu.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.320
Dinner's ready.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.980
On a day like this,

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.370
everyone should sit down

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.330
and eat a bowl of steaming rice.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.700
Are you

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.500
still traveling?

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:35.060
If your parents knew

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:37.810
you had nowhere

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.020
to stay tonight,

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.090
they'd be heartbroken.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.090
This fried tofu smells amazing.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.460
I could eat

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.300
a whole bowl of rice.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.650
Are you all right, madam?

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.710
My Yuanxu

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.410
used to say the same thing.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:18.640
He loved

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.650
my fried tofu.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:28.940
I'm sorry.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:32.570
It's fine.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:36.410
He promised to return after the war

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.170
for the Chinese New Year.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.700
Just now,

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.940
I heard a noise outside

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:46.650
and thought it might be his companions

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.810
bringing wrong news.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.410
I thought

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.850
he'd come back.

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:55.330
I didn't expect

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.260
to see you instead.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.220
I'll take you

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.260
as those he sent

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.460
to spend the Chinese New Year with me.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.060
Alright, enough talk.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.980
Eat first.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.130
I'll fry you

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.700
some eggs.

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.890
Sit.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.890
It's a kind gesture from the old lady.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:49.540
Go on, try it.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.370
The fried tofu is delicious.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.460
But it's different from what you said.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.690
This old lady may be poor,

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.770
but she added some meat.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.170
She saved this for her child.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.820
Even after they told her

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.540
he was dead,

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.340
she still holds hope.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:37.980
This is my first reunion dinner

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.570
in my life.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:48.900
Madam,

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.610
come eat with us.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:51.090
What generosity.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.820
Who'd have thought

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.030
Su Muyu, famed for his good reputation,

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.020
would leave nothing behind,

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.250
yet the ruthless Undertaker

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:01.980
left a silver ingot.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.900
I put five copper coins here

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:08.770
after the meal.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.460
Only five?

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.730
That's all I have.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:17.460
Pauper.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:19.250
Let's go.
