Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.220
This is heartwarming.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.460
This is really family.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.450
I hope Jett’ll accept and understand,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.660
so the conflict between humans and vampires can finally end.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.350
That depends on the wheel of fate.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.789
Jett.

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.910
Yes?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.720
Come pray in my room.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.810
Okay.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.020
Don’t go!

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.720
Stop! I’m telling you to stop!

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.310
Stop!

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.820
Jett.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.980
This is good, Punn.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.010
Good job peeling the onions and garlic.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.060
You cut the carrots perfectly.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.700
Well done, both of you.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.460
Hey, what’s going on?

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.490
Are you hurt?

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.220
Okay, we’ll handle that.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.020
Where are you? I’ll come right away.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.260
What’s happening?

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.800
Something’s wrong with Jett and Elise,
isn’t it?

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.820
I’m not sure yet.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.300
I’ll let you know as soon as I find out.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.740
Let me come with you.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.980
You just recovered.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.740
Stay here. Don’t go looking for trouble.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.780
I don’t want to have to heal you again.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.600
Come on!

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.780
It sounds like it from her voice.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.940
It sounds like it from her voice.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.700
The point is, it happened at the hospital.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.120
Can you coordinate getting
the emergency room ready, just in case?

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.460
The emergency room?

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.740
This must be serious.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.610
Ms. Elise!

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.620
Hang in there. Mekhin is on his way.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.720
He can help you.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.280
Jett has a weapon.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.100
What weapon?

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.950
The one that can stop Ramil
from using his powers.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.790
Are you alright?

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.860
(Please tell Mr. Punn not to worry.)

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.820
(I asked Mekhin to heal Ms. Elise
with his power. She’s safe now.)

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.430
(Please just find Feratu.
He’s taken over Mr. Jett’s body.)

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.850
Let me help with that.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.650
How’s it going?

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.260
I found Jett.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.430
Where is he?

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.700
He’s at the Hunters’ secret base.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.870
Mr. Ramil.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.930
How are you going to help Jett?

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.409
If Feratu’s controlling his mind and body,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.740
I’ll probably have to do what I did last time.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.600
If you’re using your power
to enter Jett’s mind,

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.020
can I go with you?

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.290
I’ve never taken anyone with me before.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.620
It’s very dangerous.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.500
If you get separated from me,

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.020
you won’t be able to get out.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.200
Jett is like family to me.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.660
No matter how risky it is, I’ll bring him back.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.480
Alright, let’s go.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.690
Don’t worry, Punn. Jett will be alright.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.560
We’ll save him.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.600
Let’s go inside.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.000
Give back Jett’s body, Feratu!

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.700
It’s been hundreds of years.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.020
Aren’t you going to greet your little brother?

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.350
You two came rushing in like
someone’s about to die.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:47.820
Wait,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.550
is someone really going to die today?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.160
What happened to Jett?

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.300
What did you do to him?

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.060
I don’t know.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.100
My body doesn’t work anymore,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.780
so I’m using this one instead.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:15.470
Punn!

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.230
Punn!

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.630
Or would you rather let me use your body?

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:30.700
Punn.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:33.740
Why?

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.230
Don’t you remember
who took care of all of you?

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.380
This body responds very well to my power,

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.790
don’t you think, Punn?

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.910
That’s enough, Feratu!

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.100
I told you before that

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.260
if you didn’t kill me, I’d be back to kill you.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.100
I’m going to kill your heart.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.850
If you dare to shoot your friend,

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.050
then do it!

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.060
Shoot him, Punn!

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.670
He’s not your friend anymore! He’s Feratu!

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.130
He’s a demon!

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.180
Do it, Punn.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:40.930
Shoot!

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.980
He’s a demon!

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.420
Shut up!

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.500
Punn!

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.180
You talk too much.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.980
Now die like your pets!

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.060
Ciar!

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.280
Ciar!

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.230
Ciar!

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.810
How are you?

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.790
Where’s Jett?

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.580
He went inside.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:17.630
Punn,

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.260
wait here.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.510
Let me go in alone.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.130
I’m coming with you.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.110
My brother is very dangerous.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.490
Jett is my friend.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.820
I have to save him.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.800
Take care of Ciar, Mekhin.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.380
I’m coming too.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:12.760
Punn.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.190
I’m here.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.800
Stop causing trouble already.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.230
Give back Jett’s body!

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.810
Or else, I’ll—

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:39.700
Spare my life like you did last time?

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.940
I want to end this so badly.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.160
But if you want to do it the same way as before,

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.860
try using your power to order me.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
I don’t want to use my power on you.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.120
I hope you get what I’m saying.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.600
I’m not Jonoel’s only heir like you are.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.770
I’m not as smart as you.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.220
How is this possible?

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.710
How are we going to save Jett now?

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.050
We can’t use your power to control him either. It’s Jett’s body.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.870
Mr. Ramil!

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.310
You can’t do anything to me.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.300
Mr. Ramil!

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.520
I talked to Paul and Caster.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:30.490
They said the headpiece is what’s
stopping you from controlling his mind.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.170
We need to remove it first.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.610
So you guys figured it out, huh?

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.170
If you want to take this thing off my head,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.360
then come and try.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.220
I beg you. Please don’t do this.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.650
You’re begging me?

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:57.580
Then give your life in exchange
for this headpiece.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.230
(Ciar.)

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.120
If you hurt any more of my friends again,

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.360
even hell won’t have a place for you, Feratu!

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.220
If talking won’t work,

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.100
then I guess I’ll have to show you.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:46.640
Jett!

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:48.250
Jett!

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.070
Jett!

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.240
Jett!

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:55.930
Jett!

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:04.900
Mr. Ramil!

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.660
You’ll never be able to save him.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.540
This body will be mine forever!

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:18.500
Let go!

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:20.609
Let go!

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:22.550
Let go!

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.310
Let go!

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.230
Let go!

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.260
Punn.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.430
Don’t worry, Elise.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.220
I’ll bring Jett back.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.990
You must come back to me too.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:45.720
Hey.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.060
Feratu!

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.010
Jett!

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.460
Jett!

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:07.880
Jett!

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.060
Punn!

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:17.620
Stop it, Feratu!

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.180
If I survive, I’ll hunt that boy of yours down.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.180
There won’t be a next time, Feratu.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:44.180
Jett!

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.360
Jett!

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.160
Jett!

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.940
Wake up, Jett!

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.100
May the three of us grow up together.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.070
May we stay together forever.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.660
What if we get adopted
and have to live in different homes?

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.630
So what? We’ll still be friends.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.860
No, what are we? We talked about this.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.380
Family.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.230
We’ll be family forever.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.220
Jett, wake up!

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:34.300
Jett!

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.050
Jett!

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.260
Jett!

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.720
We’re all we have, Jett!

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.170
Jett.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.860
Come back, Jett.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.900
Come back to us. Let’s be family forever.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.060
Please take care of everyone, Methus.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.040
I will, Master.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.300
It’s finally over, Punn.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:43.260
I don’t know how I would’ve made it through
without you.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.000
Thank you for staying by my side.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.090
No, I should be the one thanking you.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.500
We all survived because of you.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.670
Thank you for staying with me.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.310
Then can I stay with you forever?

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.350
I’m not going anywhere.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.460
Even if you run away from me,

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.680
I’ll still look for you.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.690
Master?

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.220
I’ve thought it through.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:30.700
I never wanted the title of vampire leader
or the hotel in the first place.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.860
I’m giving them to you.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.450
But I may not be suitable.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.230
I chose the right person, Methus.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.420
You deserve it the most.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.440
You’ve been with me through almost
every stage of my life.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:53.730
Thank you for being my most trusted
and capable brother.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.620
I’ll take good care of this place,

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.300
whether you come back or not.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.900
And as the vampire leader,

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:15.320
I’ll set all vampires free to live their own lives,

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.530
no longer under any family’s power.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.090
I knew I’d chosen the right person.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:32.280
From now on, both vampires and humans
will finally be free to live their own lives.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:47.740
What do you guys think we should do
now that there are no more Hunters?

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.900
Hmm…

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.280
I guess we’ll go our separate ways
and live our own lives.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:58.900
Only you can stay with the vampires.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.060
This one?

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:04.670
Mm-hmm.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:06.570
Here.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.500
Don’t tell me this is Ramil.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.080
No.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:13.750
Hey!

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:14.740
He’s smiling. See?

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.620
Take it back.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.200
The Hunters were just a group we imagined.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.710
Without them, we’re just ordinary humans again,

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.460
with dreams, goals,

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.280
and our own journeys.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.400
Wow, you really sound like you’re going to
join the priesthood.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.020
Hey, Jett is preparing to become a brother.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.420
I don’t know. I’m so old already.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:50.340
But I’ll help out at the orphanage anyway.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.910
Or maybe you can take over Punn’s shop.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.210
No, I’ll give it to Pokpong.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.070
Wow!

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.460
Your throat doesn’t look so red
anymore. This means you listened to me

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.130
and didn’t drink cold water.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.780
- Well done.
- Doctor.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:22.410
Hmm?

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.490
Can I have snacks now?

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.890
You’re worried about snacks again.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.820
Please.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:35.540
I’ll buy some for you.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.030
Yay!

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.180
What do you want to eat?

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.580
How about jelly candy? I have some.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.620
Hey, Doctor.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.830
Hey. You’re studying at work these days?

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.540
It’s so hard. I don’t know if I’ll survive
going back to school.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:01.660
Let me see.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.410
Maybe you substituted the values incorrectly.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.310
Look here. What should x actually be?

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.480
It should be 2.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:15.610
How?

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:23.840
Look. The question says x = 1 − 1 + 4.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:29.380
When you plug that in,
you get ½ + (√3 / 2) × i.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:32.040
Now you have the value for set 1.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:35.150
Next, find the value of set 2, okay?

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.770
Take equation 1 and apply it to equation 2.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:43.920
The theme for our gallery this month
is the moon.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:44.700
This way, please.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.580
As the new owner of the pub,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.020
I’m not letting anyone go home sober! Hey!

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:02.720
Cheers!

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:10.980
Guys, I assure you no one else in the
anti-aging industry is using this extract.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.060
Do you know what this is?

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.530
CROW, DOCTOR, PUNN’S BOYFRIEND

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.530
This is the vampire serum.

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.020
And do you know why it’s called
the vampire serum?

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.370
Because it can make you look
10 years younger!

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.770
Now, when I say “serum of vampires,”

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.770
I want everyone to shout “pires” at the end.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:29.900
I’ll start now.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.940
Serum of vam—

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:31.510
Pires!

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:32.330
Serum of vam—

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:32.740
Pires!

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:35.060
Wow, you’re all amazing!

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.390
You won’t find anything like this
in another 100 years. Trust me.

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:38.460
Isn’t it interesting?

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.230
Isn’t it interesting?

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:51.100
Who’s going to take care of these roses
from now on?

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.130
Mr. Methus?

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:55.470
Yeah.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.430
Mr. Methus can take care of these roses?

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:07.640
He has to. I won’t let them wilt.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.430
We’ve been growing them for so long.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:20.410
I can’t believe it. Everyone says
these roses are hard to take care of,

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.050
but they’ve survived until now.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.960
Nothing is too hard if you try.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.220
You sound like a life coach.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.700
What’s a life coach?

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:46.900
Someone who gives advice about life.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.540
Does that mean I’m a life coach
for these roses?

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.820
No, Mr. Ramil.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:28:59.520
Oh?

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.060
A life coach advises humans.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.220
What if I want a word to use with the roses?

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.140
How about “Daddy”?

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.340
You can be the daddy of these roses.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.620
Humans love using weird words, huh?

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.880
Your Mommy’s giving you a shower.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.100
How are you feeling, babies?

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.630
What are you talking about?

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:46.110
Well, didn’t you say I’m their Daddy?

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.540
Mommy, spray more water on our babies.

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:51.180
They need it.

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:55.080
Not Mommy. I’m their Papa.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.480
Alright, Papa.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.480
You do the spraying.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:01.790
Got it, Papa.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:07.890
Spray here too.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:18.330
Don’t forget to water them
and avoid harsh sunlight.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.820
I’ve already separated the ones that need
extra fertilizer,

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.220
so remember to add it.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.240
Got it, Master.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.230
What are you guys talking about?

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.180
Pong, we’ve talked about this.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.750
Why are you being fussy now?

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.660
Come on, Punn.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.610
How am I supposed to feel?

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.610
Happy that you’re moving away?

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.930
If it were somewhere I could follow you,
I wouldn’t be complaining.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.120
Come here.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:49.880
Come on.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.320
Don’t forget me.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:57.190
How could I forget you? You’re my brother.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:10.190
By the way, Punn, will you really not age
if you stay there?

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.620
Will you be this young forever?

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:14.660
Yes. There’s no time there.

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.050
Everything pauses in the present.

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:23.140
I’m happy anywhere you’re happy.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.540
I’ll come visit, brother.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:29.880
Okay.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:57.920
Are you sure about this, Punn?

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.550
Yes, I am.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.520
Like I said, I want to be with you forever.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.780
Then come live with me.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.180
Forever.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.300

I can’t believe forever is real.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.740
Do I get to live here forever?

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:27.030
Is there anything longer than forever?

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.660
If you want it, I’ll give it to you.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.590
In your hundred-plus years of living,

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:40.810
am I the first to get forever from you?

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:48.580
You’re the only one
who gets forever from me.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:13.010
Do you know what this necklace means?

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.090
I just know it’s as important as life.

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:37.070
Nothing matters more than you, Punn.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:45.960
I love you.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.389
I love you too, Mr. Ramil.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.180
I’ve received it. Thank you.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:26.530
(Well, the owner of the painting…)

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.940
It’s a beautiful painting.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.170
Nice to meet you, Mr. Methus.
