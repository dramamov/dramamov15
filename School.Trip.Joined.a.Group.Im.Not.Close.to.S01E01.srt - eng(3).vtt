00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.500
(Kazamino High School)

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.690
Right now,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.170
I'm facing a major problem.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.710
(School Trip Group Assignments)

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.380
It's only been two months
since we started our second year.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.900
I'm doomed.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.470
In this class,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.870
I don't have a single friend.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.090
The school trip everyone's been looking forward
to is just around the corner.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.460
Seriously, why are we having a school trip in June?

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.460
The teachers are totally overestimating
a high schooler's social skills.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.780
Okay, first things first.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.540
Get into groups of three to five,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.990
then write your members' names
on this sheet and turn it in.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.790
Okay, begin.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.410
W-Wait a second.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.770
I'm done for. What am I supposed to do?

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.030
Hioki, have you found a group yet?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.390
If you haven't decided,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.620
why don't you join us?

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.160
Huh?

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.570
It's Hotta... from junior high school.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.830
That said,

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.840
we never interacted at all back then.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.530
Why is he asking me?

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.530
So?

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.740
Are you in a group already?

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.700
Uh, no. Not yet.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.210
Great, it's settled then.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.150
Huh?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.050
Wait, wait. Why me?

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.770
By the way, the other members are...

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.550
Huh?

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.890
No way...

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.970
I've never even spoken to any of them.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.650
Come to think of it...

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.050
These four...

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.080
Aren't they...

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.320
the most popular group in the entire school?

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.240
No, no, no, no. No way, no way, no way.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.200
Absolutely not.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.830
A super elite group of handsome guys
where every single one of them is tall...

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.640
There's no way a regular guy like me could fit in...

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.200
Hioki's joining our group, too.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.510
No, I haven't...

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.540
I haven't even agreed to anything.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.370
And honestly,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.960
they don't look like they want me here at all, do they?

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.300
Um... everyone looks kind of uncomfortable.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.160
Isn't there some kind of misunderstanding?

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.630
Huh? Everyone agreed to it.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.120
No, they didn't.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.630
Uh, but I've really never talked to any of you...

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.140
Hey, since it's decided, can I write down the names?

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.280
- Oh, yeah!
- Hey, are you even listening to me?

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.700
U-Um...

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.290
Uh...

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.560
I think...

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.000
his name is...

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.880
Watarai... right?

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.010
Is it really okay? For me to join?

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.040
Yeah.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.850
By the way, just call me Watarai.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.840
Oh, and these two are Nakasato

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.490
and Morisaki.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.630
Nice to meet you.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.330
Nice to meet you.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.810
So, we're all set then, right?

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.690
Huh?

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.380
Oh...

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.040
Um...

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.360
Nice to meet you.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.320
Two months into my second year of high school,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.620
on the school trip,

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.490
I got stuck in the worst group.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.000
"School Trip: Joined a Group Iâ€™m Not Close to"

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.500
(Episode 1)

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.470
So the day has finally come.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.200
Hey, Hioki!

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.400
Hioki.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.670
Tsujitani...

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.450
You're full of energy this morning.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.120
Huh? You're in a group with the "Big Four"?!

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.230
Why?

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.410
I'd like to know that myself.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.340
I've practically never met them before...

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.350
The only one I've spoken to is Hotta.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.100
Hotta went to our middle school.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.210
That guy's a social butterfly who can get along
with anyone, young or old, male or female.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.040
You know what I'm talking about.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.470
Yeah, I know.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.770
In contrast,

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.470
Morisaki Naoya can seem a little hard to approach.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.270
But for the girls,

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.700
his cool demeanor is what makes him so charming.
It just sucks you in.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.730
What?

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.920
Sucks you in?

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.690
Nakasato Haruki is the classic "cute" type.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.500
He's really friendly.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.020
Like a pop idol?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.890
Yeah, but...

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.140
as expected,

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.850
the one who's by far the most popular

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.250
is Watarai Tsukasa.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.490
Look.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.790
He's a refreshing, handsome guy with no bad angles.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.160
He's basically a walking soft drink commercial.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680
For real.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.140
Oh.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.250
He noticed us.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.080
He's looking this way.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.120
Should I wave or something?

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.720
Ah.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.900
He's coming over.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.090
Huh?

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.220
- What do I do...?
- I'm outta here.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.700
- Huh?
- Good luck.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.980
Hey, wait...

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.040
Morning.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.320
Uh... ah...

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.230
Morning...

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.440
Good morning.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.400
This one's looking handsome this morning too.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.660
Was that your friend just now?

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.060
Oh, yeah.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.650
From middle school...

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.700
We were in the same club.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.570
I see.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.710
Did you sleep well last night?

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.540
Uh...

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.030
I was a little nervous, so I didn't get much sleep.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.250
I see.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.440
This is so awkward.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.800
Hey.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.400
Over here!

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.730
We're gathering up.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.150
Let's go then.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.650
Yeah.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.620
Morning.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.700
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.080
How should we sit on the bus?

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.570
Hey, where are our seats?

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.130
Let me see.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.250
Here and...

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.290
here.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.310
Huh?

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:12.920
I don't want to sit here.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.190
It's next to a girl.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.620
I knew you'd say that.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.510
That's why I said from the start
that the five of us should sit in the back row.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.230
But then we wouldn't be able to hear everyone else talking.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.240
Just deal with it then.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.300
- I don't know...
- Then how about you sit next to her, Hotta?

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.650
- They're arguing over something so stupid.
- Why me?

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.150
Is it that bad?

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.460
Sitting next to a girl.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.350
Let's play rock-paper-scissors for it.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:33.750
Ah...

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.560
Please, let me sit here.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.200
Um...

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.950
- No, no, over here.
- Um...

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.650
I can take that seat.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.750
Huh? Seriously?

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:43.950
Are you sure?

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.750
Yeah, I don't mind where I sit.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.270
Are you a god? Thanks!

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.220
I'll sit next to Hioki then.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:52.820
Huh?

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:53.580
Okay.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:54.430
We'll take these seats.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.260
Is that okay?

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.540
Oh... yeah.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.480
I'll sit here then.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.640
Please return to your seats.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:10.850
Although...

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.150
I wouldn't have minded sitting next to a girl.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.710
She's definitely thinking,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.030
"Why is it this guy?"

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.250
Sorry about that.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.570
That you're not sitting next to a handsome guy.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.710
Oh, sorry.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.820
It's okay.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.670
By the way, if it feels cramped,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.200
you can lean on me.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.270
No, that's okay.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.480
Thank you.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:45.810
Still,

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.910
if you were going to say all that,

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.170
I really wish you'd just switched seats with me.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.260
We'll be taking a 20-minute break.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.520
Please be back by 10:45.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.160
10:45. Take care.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.300
Hioki.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:28.920
You can sit up front for the next leg of the trip.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.260
Huh?

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.490
Watarai said you looked uncomfortable
sitting in the middle.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.700
So he suggested it.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.460
Watarai did...?

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.310
Hey, seriously?!

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.410
Oh my God, they're really here!

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.020
Is that really them?

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.380
This is insane!

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.060
Huh? Does everyone know them?

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.660
No, they must be fans from someone's Instagram.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:48.590
Huh?

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.920
Probably Watarai's or Morisaki's.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.950
They have the most followers, after all...

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.840
Come on, your numbers aren't that different.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.280
What? Yes, they are.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.850
- I only have around 25,000.
- What?

00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:59.880
25,000?

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.110
That's a lot, isn't it?

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.110
Is it?

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.450
Huh? But those two have way more, right?

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:05.560
Huh?

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.540
Look.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.340
These are Nakasato's numbers.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:09.300
Huh?

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.260
Watarai.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.770
Yes.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:14.370
And these are Morisaki's.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.490
Huh!

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.550
Um...

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.520
Are you guys celebrities or something?

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.110
No way.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.160
It's pretty normal for regular people
to have this many followers, right?

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:24.830
Is... that so?

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.820
Oh yeah, Hioki, let me get your handle too.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.130
Your IG.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.510
Huh? Oh...

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.010
I'm not really on it.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.970
Huh...

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.360
Huh?

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.380
Uh... sorry?

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.620
Feeling sleepy?

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.740
Yeah, a little.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.230
You can sleep for a bit.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.930
I'll wake you when we get there.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.660
No, it's...

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.100
Um...

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.110
Thank you.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.900
Hioki...

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.260
We're here.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:31.890
Wake up.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.150
Hioki.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.020
Oh, crap...

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.180
I-I'm so sorry!

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.000
It's fine.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.000
What horrible crime did I commit...

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.380
to fall asleep on the shoulder
of the most popular guy in our year?

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:53.570
I'm really sorry.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.950
I must have been heavy, huh?

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.010
By the way,
did I wrinkle your clothes or anything...?

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.540
No...

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.070
Don't worry about that.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.010
Huh?

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.850
Wha... What is it?

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.110
Your hair...

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.600
is messed up.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.870
Thanks...

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.680
Whoa, this is amazing.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.050
Is this outer space?

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.550
- Oh, there's a map.
- Huh?

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.340
We're here right now...

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.290
Hey, this is pretty cool, huh?

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.500
Wow, so cute.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.900
Ah...

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.220
Wanna take a picture?

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.480
Hioki, you get in too.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.060
Come on, hurry.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.430
Come on, get over here...

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.310
Closer, get closer.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.580
Okay, ready? Smile!

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.020
Hey, let's take a picture everyone!

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.360
Okay, smile!

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.630
What are you doing?

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.850
Hey, that looks good.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.050
Let's see the cool astronauts.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:28.900
Let me see.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720
Whoa.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.370
He's super tall, isn't he?

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.420
When we first got grouped together,
I was worried how it would turn out.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.090
More than I expected...

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.740
I'm glad it turned out to be more fun than I thought.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.570
Hey, did you see the Big Four' IG?

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.550
Totally. They're all ridiculously good-looking.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.840
But doesn't Hioki look out of place
in there?

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.880
Yeah, but Hioki is always alone.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.410
- They probably just felt sorry for him and invited him, right?
- You think so?

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.410
Watarai and his friends are so nice.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.150
But honestly,
I wish he wasn't in the picture.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:01.850
I know, right?

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.160
Hioki just seems...

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.870
like he's got some nerve, you know?

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:09.950
Yeah, totally.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.580
To just hang with the Big Four like that.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.500
Whoa.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.730
It's starting to rain.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.780
What should we do?

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.300
Anyone bring an umbrella?

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.350
I don't.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.270
Me neither.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.060
What about you, Hioki?

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.320
Uh...

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:30.630
I didn't bring one either.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.620
Sorry.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.960
Ah...

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.340
And we have to walk back to the hotel.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.330
Hey.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.880
I got us an umbrella.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.060
Huh? How'd you get it?

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.210
Some random guy gave it to me.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.780
Your social skills are on another level.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.590
Can we all share it?

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.530
Oh, don't worry about me.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.110
Huh...

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.140
I'll head back later.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:54.790
You guys go on ahead.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.550
But what about you, Hioki?

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.510
Me? My club members are over there.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.300
I'll be fine.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.750
- Well, let's go then.
- Yeah, okay.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.580
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:17.700
Hurry, hurry.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.700
Whoa, it's really coming down.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:23.620
Let's run for it.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.760
Whoa.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.790
Huh?

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.450
Oh.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.060
My contact lens fell out...

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.890
Oh, right, my glasses.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.180
My glasses are in my suitcase...

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.110
Hioki.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.540
Huh?

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.460
Watarai? What are you...?

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.340
I just couldn't...

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.590
I was kind of worried about you.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.380
What's wrong?

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.380
Huh? Well...

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.880
I accidentally dropped my contact lens.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.470
What?

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.680
Whoa, are you okay?

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:28.930
Yeah.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.570
Things feel a little weird...

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:31.690
But I'm okay.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.490
- Huh?
- Let's go.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.120
Huh...?

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.780
What is this...

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.560
What is happening?

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.040
I feel like everyone is staring at us.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:36.940
Groups that have their room keys,
please proceed to the banquet hall immediately.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.210
It says we have to go to the banquet hall first.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:40.940
What should we do?

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.800
But aren't our bags already in the room?

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.880
Hioki, isn't it hard for you without your glasses?

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.740
Yeah.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.510
I'll go ask the teacher.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:52.770
I'm... I'm sorry.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.310
I'm really sorry about today.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.100
You went out of your way to invite me to your group,

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.240
and I've just been causing trouble from the start...

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.210
You don't have to worry about that.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.100
I don't think you're any trouble.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.860
- But...
- Besides, I actually...

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.280
Never mind. It's nothing.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:24.780
Huh?

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.400
Is this it?

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.310
Thanks. I'll go grab them.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.700
Be careful not to fall.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.480
Did you find them?

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.480
Yeah.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:38.530
Sorry for the wait.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.160
Whoa!

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.040
I messed up.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.380
Ugh, what am I even doing?

00:20:50.404 --> 00:20:51.404
I'm sorry...

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Ah...

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.620
Are you okay?

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.700
Ah... Yeah.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:03.430
I'm okay.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.860
That's good.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.910
I just told you to be careful not to fall, didn't I?

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.880
Huh?

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.190
He's not mad.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.230
If anything...

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.640
it's the opposite...

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.480
Are you sure you're not hurt?

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.370
What is...

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.400
this feeling?

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:42.290
I can't...

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.280
I feel like... I just...

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.600
I'll do anything if you'll just forgive me.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:56.710
Oh?

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.340
Anything, you say?

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.190
Huh?

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.800
Uh, well, right now... W-Wait a second.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.710
Th-That...

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.740
Can you just forget what I just said?

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.750
Nope.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:17.870
An instant no?!

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.150
Wait, what did I even say?

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.750
I said I'd 'do anything'?

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.480
Watarai wants me to...

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.020
do what?!

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.170
Um, well...

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.560
What's going to happen to me?

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.500
Who knows?

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.540
I'll think about it.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.400
By the time this school trip...

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.060
is over.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.450
On the very first day of the school trip,

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:45.470
things already seem to be getting out of hand.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.180
(Next Episode)
Hey, I heard you held hands with Watarai Tsukasa.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.080
So cute.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.000
(A naked date with the hottie squad.)

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.240
(The first night together...)
Let's talk about love.

00:23:02.541 --> 00:23:03.715
(As the two of them get closer...)
You're not the type

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.970
who, when you fall for someone,

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.570
ends up falling way too hard, are you?

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:07.830
Give me a break.
