‎PREVIOUSLY ON ‎CHOSEN HOME

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.846
An animal lover
who's gentle-hearted and gay,

00:00:07.912 --> 00:00:09.180
Genichi Hatano,

00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:12.750
falls in love.

00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:16.688
His crush is a fellow gay man
and middle school teacher, Saku Sakuta.

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:18.456
I broke up with my partner
and ended our cohabitation.

00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:20.625
I was spending the night in my car.

00:00:20.692 --> 00:00:23.061
Genichi wishes for Saku’s happiness.

00:00:23.128 --> 00:00:24.963
What do you think about buying a house?

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.065
Maybe buying a house could be the "clamp".

00:00:27.132 --> 00:00:28.533
Do as you like.

00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:32.837
But Saku has a problematic student.

00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:35.373
Hotaru Kusunoki.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.443
She's a third-year middle schooler
who hangs around the red light district.

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.180
This is my dad.

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:44.649
Yes, he's my dad!

00:00:44.716 --> 00:00:45.550
I'm begging you.

00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:48.419
For some reason, Hotaru wants him
to pretend to be her dad.

00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:50.955
With the suitcase buried in the yard,

00:00:51.022 --> 00:00:53.691
Hotaru decides to pull off
the gamble of her lifetime.

00:00:54.926 --> 00:00:57.028
-What the?
-Here is 30 million yen.

00:00:58.062 --> 00:01:00.098
You want a house, right?

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:02.834
I will… buy you.

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:07.038
-What do you mean, buy?
-With this money.

00:01:07.105 --> 00:01:08.206
-Me, that is?
-Yes.

00:01:08.273 --> 00:01:09.374
What do you mean?

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.609
I'm saying I'll give you this money.

00:01:11.676 --> 00:01:13.011
You then use it to buy a house,

00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:15.980
but in return, I want you
to pretend to be my dad.

00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:18.016
-I don't get it.
-Like I said--

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:20.218
First of all, what's this money?

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:22.086
-Whose is it?
-Ours.

00:01:23.988 --> 00:01:26.824
Your mom. Where is she now?

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:29.294
Can't you ask your dad from the other day?

00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:32.397
I can tell you’ve got
your reasons in a way.

00:01:33.064 --> 00:01:34.299
But you should talk to your teac--

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:36.234
I'm saying I don't want to!

00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:37.302
Why not?

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:40.271
I’m not asking you
to become my real parent.

00:01:40.338 --> 00:01:42.941
Just act the part when it’s needed.

00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:43.942
Come on now.

00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:45.577
Do you know what you're saying?

00:01:46.144 --> 00:01:47.478
It's not something I can just do.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.014
Why are you alone?

00:01:50.782 --> 00:01:52.951
At least tell me the reason.

00:01:53.017 --> 00:01:55.687
And this money.
Give me a proper explanation, okay?

00:01:56.187 --> 00:01:58.790
With this much, we could buy
a nice big house!

00:01:58.856 --> 00:01:59.958
One where the dogs could run around!

00:02:02.994 --> 00:02:04.295
Wouldn’t that be fun?

00:02:04.362 --> 00:02:06.431
Hey, stop it. Let's put this away, yeah?

00:02:06.497 --> 00:02:08.433
And a big bath
where you can splash around!

00:02:09.968 --> 00:02:12.737
-We don’t need that kind of house.
-Then what kind do you want?

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.675
I’m buying you,
so pick any house you like.

00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:22.614
Coming! Please wait a moment.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.148
Hey, careful.

00:02:27.752 --> 00:02:30.355
-Yes?
-Hello. Delivery service.

00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:33.091
Please sign here.

00:02:33.157 --> 00:02:35.260
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:39.731
These are shishamo fish
from my parents in Hokkaido.

00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:42.267
They always send me tons
around this time of year.

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:43.401
Oh yeah?

00:02:44.102 --> 00:02:46.104
Want some? I'll share it with you.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.472
Thank you.

00:02:48.606 --> 00:02:50.508
What do you usually eat?

00:02:51.242 --> 00:02:52.343
You live alone, right?

00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:56.180
-I just eat whatever.
-What about money? Your living expenses?

00:02:56.247 --> 00:02:58.483
-I'm fine.
-Really?

00:03:00.051 --> 00:03:01.552
-Thank you for this.
-Huh?

00:03:02.287 --> 00:03:04.856
-So, I’ll be counting on you.
-Wait, hey, your--

00:03:04.922 --> 00:03:07.525
-Thank you for having me.
-What?

00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:15.033
SHISHAMO WITH ROE

00:03:21.706 --> 00:03:25.176
There. We're good to go.

00:03:31.416 --> 00:03:32.550
Sorry, give me a second.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:08.786
What did I do with it?

00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:11.089
Where is it?

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:12.990
Looking for something?

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.495
-No way!
-No way?

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:20.465
-Do you need some help?
-No, thank you.

00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:25.570
A sock, huh?

00:04:25.636 --> 00:04:29.407
They usually fall between the washer
and the wall, you know.

00:04:29.474 --> 00:04:33.277
Well, I don't have a house.
"Between the washer and the wall," sure.

00:04:35.646 --> 00:04:38.049
Um, about Yoshida…

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.252
Have you spoken to Hotaru
about her future?

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.021
She'd better hand in
her career sheet soon.

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:56.134
I'll just wear this one.

00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:04.308
Man, you're such a nuis--

00:05:07.512 --> 00:05:09.781
Someone was camping out in their car,
so I told them off.

00:05:09.847 --> 00:05:11.749
-Got it.
-I'll be on my way now.

00:05:11.816 --> 00:05:13.384
Thank you for your work.

00:05:16.487 --> 00:05:17.321
Something happened?

00:05:17.388 --> 00:05:21.025
Someone was camping out
in their car in the lot.

00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:22.827
Security reported
that he gave them a warning.

00:05:22.894 --> 00:05:25.997
I hope they take it well though.

00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:27.965
Right.

00:05:28.566 --> 00:05:30.935
LIST OF CAR CAMPING SPOTS IN TOKYO

00:05:31.002 --> 00:05:32.703
I came to hand in the class journal.

00:05:35.206 --> 00:05:36.441
Thanks.

00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:38.943
-Bye.
-Wait!

00:05:41.312 --> 00:05:43.414
Is he okay? I mean, your dad.

00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:46.451
What do you mean?

00:05:47.385 --> 00:05:48.219
With stuff.

00:05:49.587 --> 00:05:50.488
What stuff?

00:05:51.422 --> 00:05:52.256
Never mind.

00:05:53.324 --> 00:05:54.725
If he's okay, then it's all good.

00:05:55.993 --> 00:05:59.363
Are you okay? Your socks don't match.

00:05:59.897 --> 00:06:00.731
Bye.

00:06:09.674 --> 00:06:11.409
TO KUSUNOKI. I’VE LIKED YOU

00:06:11.476 --> 00:06:13.444
FOR A LONG TIME
PLEASE MEET ME BEHIND THE GYM

00:06:13.511 --> 00:06:14.479
AFTER SCHOOL ON MONDAY

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.785
How about homework?

00:06:29.794 --> 00:06:32.630
GAS BILL

00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:46.077
TO KUSUNOKI
I’VE LIKED YOU FOR A LONG TIME…

00:06:57.722 --> 00:06:59.490
DAD

00:07:00.992 --> 00:07:02.560
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

00:07:02.627 --> 00:07:05.296
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

00:07:05.363 --> 00:07:07.832
How's the unit?
It's old, so I'm a little concerned.

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:09.267
-Are you fine with it?
-Yes.

00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:12.270
I’m content just having
a roof over my head.

00:07:16.674 --> 00:07:18.242
I'm back, Banana.

00:07:21.579 --> 00:07:23.347
Sorry, I need you to make way.

00:07:33.057 --> 00:07:34.592
SAKUTA

00:07:41.532 --> 00:07:42.733
This is Hatano speaking.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.769
This is Sakuta.

00:07:46.137 --> 00:07:48.072
-Is everything okay?
-What?

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.408
The guard told you off
about sleeping in your car, right?

00:07:51.709 --> 00:07:53.644
More importantly, regarding Hotaru…

00:07:54.645 --> 00:07:56.814
-Are you listening?
-Yes.

00:07:57.315 --> 00:07:58.249
Three months ago,

00:07:58.316 --> 00:07:59.850
the police, Hotaru, and I

00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:01.319
had a session.

00:08:01.385 --> 00:08:03.788
This time, we’d like her dad to join us.

00:08:04.522 --> 00:08:05.790
Wait, the police?

00:08:05.856 --> 00:08:08.593
The officer-in-charge is called Mr. Matsu.

00:08:09.193 --> 00:08:10.661
You haven't met him before, right?

00:08:11.462 --> 00:08:13.030
We’d like to go over the incident,

00:08:13.097 --> 00:08:16.834
your current situation as her dad,
and other related matters.

00:08:17.635 --> 00:08:19.203
When would be a good time for you?

00:08:20.471 --> 00:08:21.405
Well…

00:08:22.773 --> 00:08:24.542
How about next Tuesday?

00:08:24.609 --> 00:08:26.077
Maybe around 6 p.m.?

00:08:27.211 --> 00:08:28.679
-Okay.
-See you then.

00:08:29.547 --> 00:08:31.515
-Thank you.
-See you.

00:08:36.787 --> 00:08:38.923
YOSHIDA: CAN WE MEET THIS WEEKEND?

00:08:44.061 --> 00:08:46.731
-Oh, Hotaru!
-Hey.

00:08:46.797 --> 00:08:48.666
We're doing something fun!

00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:50.167
Let me in on it.

00:08:50.835 --> 00:08:53.270
We’re doing a fake press conference!

00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:57.575
Which celebrity
does your fiancé look like?

00:08:57.642 --> 00:09:00.244
-He's just some old guy.
-Did you hear that?

00:09:00.311 --> 00:09:01.746
What made you decide to get married?

00:09:01.812 --> 00:09:03.981
-Huh? Marriage?!
-Well…

00:09:04.048 --> 00:09:07.485
-It's got to be his financial stability.
-Wait, are you getting married, Nacchi?

00:09:09.453 --> 00:09:11.322
Of course not!

00:09:11.989 --> 00:09:13.691
Thank goodness.

00:09:13.758 --> 00:09:16.994
-You scared me!
-Did you believe it?

00:09:17.061 --> 00:09:19.163
-Tell us. Did you?
-Shut up!

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.633
An older guy she got along well with
offered her a prenuptial agreement.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.701
Or so she said.

00:09:24.268 --> 00:09:25.503
What's that?

00:09:25.569 --> 00:09:27.905
I guess it's like a promise to marry
or something?

00:09:27.972 --> 00:09:30.641
A "We’ll get married someday,
so let’s do our best" type of agreement.

00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:32.109
-Cheers!
-Do your best!

00:09:32.176 --> 00:09:33.044
Wait…

00:09:33.544 --> 00:09:36.547
If I sign the agreement,
he’ll give me 50,000 yen every month.

00:09:36.614 --> 00:09:39.417
I’ll take all the money I can,
and once it gets annoying,

00:09:39.483 --> 00:09:40.851
I'll just abandon him.

00:09:40.918 --> 00:09:42.720
-You're a genius!
-Genius idea!

00:09:42.787 --> 00:09:43.621
Hi-five!

00:09:43.688 --> 00:09:44.689
Look at this!

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.793
"For indecent acts with a minor,

00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:50.227
a man was arrested…"

00:09:50.294 --> 00:09:53.097
If it's proven the guy had
a prenuptial agreement with the girl

00:09:53.164 --> 00:09:55.499
and they were in
an engagement-like relationship,

00:09:55.566 --> 00:09:57.835
it may not be considered
a violation of law.

00:09:57.902 --> 00:10:00.271
-Meaning?
-Even if he does something gross to you,

00:10:00.337 --> 00:10:01.238
he might not get arrested!

00:10:01.305 --> 00:10:03.808
-That's not good.
-Do you have the agreement with you?

00:10:03.874 --> 00:10:05.042
No, it's with him.

00:10:06.544 --> 00:10:07.578
What, you don't have it?

00:10:07.645 --> 00:10:09.046
-No!
-What?

00:10:09.113 --> 00:10:10.981
CAREER SHEET

00:10:16.153 --> 00:10:17.955
Are you looking for Hotaru?

00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:20.191
Yes.

00:10:20.257 --> 00:10:23.661
She usually doesn’t come back until
late at night on the days she goes out.

00:10:23.728 --> 00:10:26.230
You'll probably have to wait
a little longer.

00:10:26.897 --> 00:10:29.133
Um… Do you know her situation?

00:10:30.868 --> 00:10:31.936
‎Well,

00:10:32.002 --> 00:10:34.138
I mean, Hotaru's circumstances.

00:10:36.073 --> 00:10:37.308
That's a secret.

00:10:37.374 --> 00:10:38.743
Right.

00:10:39.543 --> 00:10:40.411
NIKOMADO

00:10:40.478 --> 00:10:42.613
Speaking of which,
was everything okay the other day?

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.682
I heard you had trouble with some kids.

00:10:44.749 --> 00:10:48.652
Oh, that. They were collecting coins,

00:10:48.719 --> 00:10:50.554
so I thought they must be
really short on money.

00:10:50.621 --> 00:10:53.657
When I asked them,
"Is there anything you want?",

00:10:53.724 --> 00:10:55.359
they got creeped out.

00:10:55.426 --> 00:10:57.895
Well, yeah.
It’s creepy and kinda annoying.

00:10:57.962 --> 00:10:59.396
Really?

00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:04.101
But I did clear the misunderstanding
with them later.

00:11:06.003 --> 00:11:07.538
There he is. Koinobori!

00:11:07.605 --> 00:11:09.406
Oh, just as we speak of them.

00:11:11.408 --> 00:11:12.743
What's wrong?

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.746
-Hey, won't you marry me too?
-Me too, please!

00:11:15.813 --> 00:11:17.014
-You too?
-No, me.

00:11:17.081 --> 00:11:18.682
-So hard to decide…
-Please!

00:11:18.749 --> 00:11:20.651
-Please!
-Pretty please!

00:11:20.718 --> 00:11:23.220
-How old are you, anyway?
-Well, I'm…

00:11:23.287 --> 00:11:24.655
Sorry for interrupting.

00:11:25.489 --> 00:11:28.492
Hello. I’m with Nikomado,
from the Niko Consultation Desk.

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:32.062
I heard about what happened.
So, what’s this prenuptial agreement?

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:34.298
Let’s go to the police together.

00:11:35.766 --> 00:11:37.034
I don't wanna!

00:11:37.101 --> 00:11:38.602
Hand it over!

00:11:39.103 --> 00:11:41.205
Nicely done!

00:11:41.272 --> 00:11:42.173
This?

00:11:42.239 --> 00:11:43.474
That's not it.

00:11:43.541 --> 00:11:44.575
-This!
-Yes!

00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:46.277
Let's get out of here!

00:11:46.343 --> 00:11:47.778
Quick!

00:11:47.845 --> 00:11:49.046
Wait!

00:11:49.113 --> 00:11:50.314
-Where are you going?
-Hey!

00:11:54.785 --> 00:11:56.153
PARKING
2,000 YEN FOR THE FIRST 24 HOURS

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.788
That's so expensive!

00:12:04.695 --> 00:12:05.663
Time to sleep.

00:12:25.149 --> 00:12:27.218
So, I suggested we buy a house

00:12:27.284 --> 00:12:30.120
and make it our "family glue".

00:12:30.921 --> 00:12:32.423
Guess what? He said I'm scaring him.

00:12:32.489 --> 00:12:34.091
He's got a point.

00:12:34.158 --> 00:12:36.961
But the one who said "love and revolution"
and "family glue"

00:12:37.027 --> 00:12:40.531
was you, Ms. Momose.
That really lit a fire in me!

00:12:40.598 --> 00:12:41.799
Oh, no.

00:12:41.866 --> 00:12:45.202
I assumed it was for the sake
of your partner.

00:12:45.803 --> 00:12:48.439
I don’t have anyone like that.

00:12:48.505 --> 00:12:51.475
Then, can I take it that you're here today
to join the membership?

00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:52.776
Hang on…

00:12:53.277 --> 00:12:55.746
Looking back,

00:12:55.813 --> 00:12:59.149
I think I suggested the "family glue" idea
because I wanted that person to be happy.

00:12:59.216 --> 00:13:02.286
So, I can’t actually join.

00:13:02.353 --> 00:13:05.589
Does that mean it’s already started?

00:13:05.656 --> 00:13:08.726
It might have already started… I think.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.128
-Lots of things.
-Really?

00:13:12.229 --> 00:13:13.230
You know…

00:13:14.198 --> 00:13:15.699
-A kid…
-Wait, did you say, kid?

00:13:16.267 --> 00:13:17.768
Your partner has a child?

00:13:17.835 --> 00:13:19.536
It's not exactly that.

00:13:20.738 --> 00:13:24.208
-I don’t quite understand the situation.
-Me neither.

00:13:26.343 --> 00:13:29.480
I love parfaits.

00:13:30.314 --> 00:13:31.215
Why all of a sudden?

00:13:32.283 --> 00:13:35.052
To me, a parfait is life.

00:13:35.119 --> 00:13:37.955
The cream, the fruits, the cereal.

00:13:38.022 --> 00:13:40.958
They all stack together
to make the parfait, right?

00:13:41.692 --> 00:13:44.194
Similarly, life is made up

00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:46.430
of the accumulation of what we do
in the present.

00:13:47.097 --> 00:13:49.600
If you do what you can

00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:52.803
and what you should now,

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.940
eventually, you’ll realize
you’ve made a proper parfait.

00:13:56.974 --> 00:13:58.108
Is that…

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.811
from Dazai or something too?

00:14:00.878 --> 00:14:04.114
No. It's Momose's original quote.

00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:06.083
Where is it?

00:14:06.884 --> 00:14:09.186
-Looking for something?
-Yeah.

00:14:09.253 --> 00:14:12.957
Have you seen a Santa-patterned sock?

00:14:13.023 --> 00:14:15.492
-Nope.
-Maybe over there.

00:14:16.727 --> 00:14:19.663
-Is it that important?
-I don't know.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.398
I'm just searching for it for no reason.

00:14:22.499 --> 00:14:23.534
Why?

00:14:24.468 --> 00:14:25.502
For my parfait.

00:14:33.444 --> 00:14:36.413
Welcome home. I mean, please come on in.

00:14:37.581 --> 00:14:39.783
-Thank you for having me.
-Wear these.

00:14:45.222 --> 00:14:46.690
Did you rearrange the place?

00:14:46.757 --> 00:14:49.960
Well, duh. Also, those are your things.

00:14:50.027 --> 00:14:53.030
The stuff in the bathroom…
I couldn’t tell whose was whose,

00:14:53.097 --> 00:14:54.198
so just take yours back.

00:14:54.264 --> 00:14:56.800
You're the type to delete all photos
after breaking up.

00:14:56.867 --> 00:14:58.969
I throw away all the gifts too.

00:15:00.237 --> 00:15:02.473
-I thought this was about Hatano.
-What?

00:15:03.173 --> 00:15:05.242
Didn't he come
with the marriage registration?

00:15:05.743 --> 00:15:07.611
Oh yeah, he did.

00:15:07.678 --> 00:15:09.646
But seriously, don't go passing that
to randoms.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.016
I didn't think he'd go see you.

00:15:12.883 --> 00:15:16.553
In the end, I still don’t know
why he came.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.688
What did you talk about?

00:15:17.755 --> 00:15:21.558
Can’t remember much… What was it again?

00:15:22.893 --> 00:15:24.995
He said he wanted to fall madly in love.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.633
-He told me to buy a house.
-Huh?

00:15:30.768 --> 00:15:32.636
He said you and I
should buy a house together,

00:15:32.703 --> 00:15:35.906
and use that as a clamp,
so we’d always be together.

00:15:35.973 --> 00:15:36.940
How does that work?

00:15:37.007 --> 00:15:40.377
-I don’t know.
-He's crazy.

00:15:40.444 --> 00:15:42.012
I know, right?

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:47.618
Are you done?

00:15:51.588 --> 00:15:52.423
This is everything.

00:15:54.725 --> 00:15:57.895
Why don't we stay together
until we can file the marriage papers?

00:16:00.097 --> 00:16:02.499
What? You're being a creep.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.636
-Figured.
-See you.

00:16:06.203 --> 00:16:07.104
Thanks for having me.

00:16:08.672 --> 00:16:09.573
See you.

00:16:16.113 --> 00:16:17.781
Hey! Wait here.

00:16:22.052 --> 00:16:23.187
Are you okay?

00:16:25.422 --> 00:16:27.024
Dang it!

00:16:27.091 --> 00:16:29.159
-Open the door!
-No, I'm fine!

00:16:29.226 --> 00:16:30.828
-Just open the goddamn door!
-Ugh!

00:16:34.698 --> 00:16:35.599
If you don't mind me…

00:16:38.802 --> 00:16:40.104
Get out of the way!

00:16:41.371 --> 00:16:44.041
It's a good thing the fire didn’t spread.

00:16:44.108 --> 00:16:45.742
You could say that again.

00:16:45.809 --> 00:16:48.278
I was grilling the shishamo fish,
and it exploded into flames.

00:16:48.946 --> 00:16:51.648
Shishamo?
You've got quite the refined taste.

00:16:51.715 --> 00:16:53.117
I shared some with her.

00:16:53.717 --> 00:16:54.952
It came from Hokkaido.

00:16:55.786 --> 00:16:56.954
Is that so?

00:16:57.855 --> 00:17:00.224
Sorry, I didn’t teach her
how to cook them properly.

00:17:00.858 --> 00:17:02.359
I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:17:02.426 --> 00:17:03.927
It’s totally fine,

00:17:04.761 --> 00:17:06.730
but I don’t get any shishamo, huh?

00:17:07.464 --> 00:17:08.332
Huh?

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.569
I see how it is.
Shishamo from Hokkaido, huh?

00:17:13.437 --> 00:17:16.740
That's cool. It must be good shishamo.

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:19.543
-Maybe it's karafuto shishamo.
-I'll bring some to her.

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:20.777
-You'd better.
-Right.

00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:26.783
Let's clean this up, yeah?

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.153
-I can do it by myself.
-Don't be shy.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.494
Genichi, the guy living below,
how are things with him?

00:17:38.695 --> 00:17:41.198
Sometimes I hear him playing the guitar.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:43.967
Think it's noisy?

00:17:45.536 --> 00:17:46.703
Not really.

00:17:47.871 --> 00:17:50.240
Aren't his songs amazing?

00:17:50.974 --> 00:17:52.342
I don't know.

00:17:52.409 --> 00:17:54.811
He was once offered the chance to debut.

00:17:55.479 --> 00:17:56.413
Really?

00:17:57.247 --> 00:17:58.448
As a musician, that is.

00:17:59.383 --> 00:18:00.584
I'm proud of him as a friend.

00:18:07.191 --> 00:18:10.127
Take care. Say hi to your parents for me.

00:18:11.161 --> 00:18:11.995
Okay.

00:18:13.197 --> 00:18:15.232
-Thanks. See you.
-See you.

00:18:20.871 --> 00:18:22.506
Wanna try grilling the shishamo again?

00:18:25.175 --> 00:18:29.313
If you make a hole like this
before grilling,

00:18:29.379 --> 00:18:30.781
they won’t explode.

00:18:35.485 --> 00:18:36.720
-Like this?
-Yes.

00:18:39.389 --> 00:18:41.225
I got a call from Sakuta.

00:18:41.858 --> 00:18:44.695
-About the other day?
-It's about another matter.

00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:47.064
The one with Mr. Matsu from the police.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:51.335
Apparently there’s a meeting with him,
you, me, and your teacher.

00:18:51.902 --> 00:18:53.971
Why are the police involved?

00:18:54.037 --> 00:18:56.206
Is it about your mom or dad?

00:18:56.273 --> 00:18:57.674
Something like that.

00:18:59.876 --> 00:19:02.246
It's going to be next Tuesday,
6 p.m., at school.

00:19:02.312 --> 00:19:04.715
We’ll tell them the truth

00:19:05.282 --> 00:19:07.150
-and get some advice from your teacher.
-No!

00:19:07.884 --> 00:19:09.253
I absolutely don't wanna.

00:19:10.554 --> 00:19:11.622
I won't go then.

00:19:12.122 --> 00:19:15.359
Look, could you tell me what happened?

00:19:16.059 --> 00:19:18.996
About the incident, the police, the money…

00:19:19.062 --> 00:19:22.366
I don’t know anything.
So, please, give me the rundown.

00:19:24.601 --> 00:19:25.836
Okay!

00:19:25.902 --> 00:19:28.905
I’ll tell you everything,
only if you'll pretend to be my parent.

00:19:28.972 --> 00:19:30.741
-Now that's--
-Please!

00:19:32.809 --> 00:19:36.113
Or you can just listen
and think about it for now.

00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:38.448
-Well yeah, I'll think about it, but…
-You will?

00:19:38.515 --> 00:19:39.950
That's not what I meant.

00:19:40.017 --> 00:19:42.219
-I'll go and get ready.
-Get ready?

00:19:44.888 --> 00:19:47.090
Oh, and before I forget. This.

00:19:47.157 --> 00:19:48.525
CAREER SHEET

00:19:48.592 --> 00:19:49.993
He said to submit it.

00:19:51.461 --> 00:19:52.729
Ever filled one out before?

00:19:53.363 --> 00:19:54.531
Well, yeah.

00:19:54.598 --> 00:19:56.633
What did you write
when you were in middle school?

00:19:58.535 --> 00:19:59.636
Musician.

00:20:00.937 --> 00:20:01.972
Makes sense.

00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:04.708
You like music.

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:06.643
You don’t have anything you like?

00:20:07.511 --> 00:20:08.478
I don't know.

00:20:09.746 --> 00:20:10.981
I see.

00:20:12.015 --> 00:20:12.983
Okay, let’s eat.

00:20:14.518 --> 00:20:16.186
-Thanks for the meal.
-Not at all.

00:20:26.797 --> 00:20:27.631
It's tasty.

00:20:29.032 --> 00:20:30.267
I'm glad to hear that.

00:20:31.835 --> 00:20:35.605
Fifty-five minutes
to Zenpukuji Middle School.

00:20:35.672 --> 00:20:37.040
So, I need to wake up at 5 a.m.?

00:20:39.576 --> 00:20:42.079
Today’s place to sleep

00:20:42.145 --> 00:20:45.349
Is on a park bench

00:20:45.415 --> 00:20:47.884
Sleeping in cramped spots

00:20:48.518 --> 00:20:51.588
Is what you're used to

00:20:51.655 --> 00:20:57.227
Tomorrow’s place will be in a car

00:20:57.294 --> 00:20:58.862
Fallen

00:20:58.929 --> 00:21:05.635
Leaves will wrap you up

00:21:09.106 --> 00:21:09.940
Hang in there, me.

00:21:10.006 --> 00:21:12.376
No home

00:21:13.043 --> 00:21:15.579
Oh, no home

00:21:15.645 --> 00:21:18.482
The vast sky

00:21:18.548 --> 00:21:20.684
Is your roof

00:21:21.418 --> 00:21:24.154
The day after tomorrow…

00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:26.289
The day after tomorrow…

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:32.362
Let's go look for your new home

00:21:32.863 --> 00:21:34.164
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:21:36.833 --> 00:21:37.901
Bye.

00:21:39.102 --> 00:21:41.772
Will you have your career sheet
ready by Tuesday?

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.709
-Yes.
-This time, no blanks, okay?

00:21:45.776 --> 00:21:46.610
Okay.

00:21:47.511 --> 00:21:50.580
Are you getting along well with your dad?

00:21:52.916 --> 00:21:54.084
He grilled shishamo for me.

00:21:54.151 --> 00:21:56.286
He also taught me
how to prevent them from exploding.

00:21:57.487 --> 00:21:59.623
-They explode?
-With a bang.

00:22:00.424 --> 00:22:02.025
Please be careful too.

00:22:03.059 --> 00:22:05.195
Shishamo… explode?

00:22:08.632 --> 00:22:11.435
PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT

00:22:11.501 --> 00:22:12.335
Uh…

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.272
Who's this "party A"?

00:22:15.772 --> 00:22:17.874
It refers to that guy.

00:22:17.941 --> 00:22:19.743
And "party B" is you.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.346
Then, why can't he write "me" and "you"?

00:22:23.413 --> 00:22:25.449
-You're right.
-Kinda stupid, huh?

00:22:25.515 --> 00:22:28.218
Adults are so lame!

00:22:31.054 --> 00:22:32.756
31,500,000 YEN

00:22:33.623 --> 00:22:34.524
Coming.

00:22:36.026 --> 00:22:37.194
I'm ready.

00:22:38.795 --> 00:22:41.231
Okay, let’s read through this together.

00:22:41.932 --> 00:22:42.866
Parent-Child Contract.

00:22:42.933 --> 00:22:43.900
PARENT-CHILD CONTRACT

00:22:47.471 --> 00:22:49.840
From this point forward, Hotaru Kusunoki,

00:22:49.906 --> 00:22:51.174
hereafter referred to as "Party A",

00:22:51.241 --> 00:22:53.610
and Genichi Hatano,
hereafter referred to as "Party B",

00:22:53.677 --> 00:22:55.345
agree to enter

00:22:55.412 --> 00:22:58.348
into the following terms
of a parent-child contract,

00:22:58.415 --> 00:23:00.884
hereafter referred to as "this Contract".

00:23:00.951 --> 00:23:03.286
Now, hold on. What is this?

00:23:03.353 --> 00:23:04.654
It's a contract.

00:23:05.155 --> 00:23:06.389
You've got to be joking…

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.458
You can sign at the end.

00:23:09.659 --> 00:23:11.595
-Article One…
-Wait!

00:23:12.362 --> 00:23:13.563
You’d think about it, right?

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.365
Well, yeah. But…

00:23:15.432 --> 00:23:18.201
I’ll tell you everything,
so please listen till the end.

00:23:18.268 --> 00:23:19.536
Okay.

00:23:20.036 --> 00:23:22.472
Article One. Purpose.

00:23:23.106 --> 00:23:26.109
Under all circumstances, Party A
and Party B shall support one another

00:23:26.743 --> 00:23:30.380
and strive to maintain a harmonious
pretend parent-child relationship.

00:23:30.447 --> 00:23:32.582
The parties enter
into this agreement for this purpose.

00:23:33.116 --> 00:23:35.151
Article Two. Agreement.

00:23:35.652 --> 00:23:37.921
Party A and Party B
hereby agree on October 20th,

00:23:37.988 --> 00:23:41.391
2025, to enter
into a parent-child contract.

00:23:41.458 --> 00:23:44.794
Article Three. About Party A. First,

00:23:44.861 --> 00:23:46.963
Party A was born on August 26,

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.966
2010, 15 years old.

00:23:50.033 --> 00:23:52.903
Third-year student
at Zenpukuji Middle School, Class 4.

00:23:53.403 --> 00:23:55.906
Second, they currently reside
at Inokashira Apartments,

00:23:55.972 --> 00:23:57.908
Room 206.

00:23:58.642 --> 00:24:01.211
Three, their father, Jin Ichigaya,

00:24:01.278 --> 00:24:04.314
divorced when Party A was nine
and has since left home.

00:24:04.381 --> 00:24:07.751
He remarried and started a new family,
so he’s not someone they can rely on.

00:24:08.752 --> 00:24:10.620
That was the man from the crepe place?

00:24:10.687 --> 00:24:13.590
I actually wanted him to come
to my parent-teacher conference,

00:24:13.657 --> 00:24:16.126
but it was apparently
inconvenient for him.

00:24:16.192 --> 00:24:17.994
I don’t matter to him anymore.

00:24:19.763 --> 00:24:21.831
-Anyway, moving on.
-Uh, okay.

00:24:21.898 --> 00:24:24.301
Four, Party A’s mother, Tomoe Kusunoki,

00:24:24.367 --> 00:24:27.938
is currently wanted for embezzlement
from her company and is on the run.

00:24:29.873 --> 00:24:32.175
She stole money and is on the run.

00:24:32.242 --> 00:24:34.210
Since then, I’ve been on my own.

00:24:34.811 --> 00:24:36.246
MOM

00:24:40.617 --> 00:24:43.053
-Hello?
-Morning, Hotaru.

00:24:43.119 --> 00:24:44.621
Mom?

00:24:44.688 --> 00:24:47.223
Listen, I won’t be coming home
for a while.

00:24:48.725 --> 00:24:49.759
I’m sorry.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.395
There’s a bankbook on the desk.

00:24:52.462 --> 00:24:54.864
For the time being,
use that money carefully, okay?

00:24:55.865 --> 00:24:57.067
With the landlady,

00:24:57.701 --> 00:24:59.869
I left a suitcase.

00:25:00.904 --> 00:25:04.074
What’s inside belongs to us.

00:25:04.841 --> 00:25:06.376
Us?

00:25:06.443 --> 00:25:08.478
Until I'm back,

00:25:08.545 --> 00:25:11.481
I’m leaving it in your care. I'll be back.

00:25:13.016 --> 00:25:13.950
Okay.

00:25:14.951 --> 00:25:17.187
But not long after that, the police came.

00:25:17.253 --> 00:25:20.156
They said my mom stole money and ran off

00:25:20.223 --> 00:25:21.758
and asked if I knew where she was.

00:25:22.258 --> 00:25:23.893
Like I'd believe that, right?

00:25:25.595 --> 00:25:29.132
But they kept asking and asking,
and it started to sound like it was true.

00:25:30.734 --> 00:25:32.168
The police searched the apartment,

00:25:32.235 --> 00:25:33.370
looking for the money.

00:25:34.037 --> 00:25:36.773
It used to be just me and Mom
living there,

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.476
but little by little, it started to feel
like someone else’s home.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.079
Soon after, someone
from the child guidance center came.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.982
Regarding your situation going forward…

00:25:47.117 --> 00:25:49.419
Since you can’t live alone,

00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:52.355
if your dad or relatives

00:25:53.256 --> 00:25:55.859
can't take you in,

00:25:56.359 --> 00:25:58.361
we’ll need to find a facility for you.

00:25:58.428 --> 00:25:59.396
I'm good.

00:25:59.462 --> 00:26:02.632
My mom said on the phone
that she’d only be gone for a while.

00:26:02.699 --> 00:26:03.600
So,

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.002
she’ll come back eventually.

00:26:06.069 --> 00:26:08.171
I’ll stay here and wait.

00:26:08.238 --> 00:26:10.140
I understand how you feel,

00:26:10.206 --> 00:26:12.575
but for now, let’s head
to the facility, okay?

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:14.844
Ms. Kusunoki?

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.148
My dad.

00:26:18.214 --> 00:26:20.383
My dad who left after the divorce.

00:26:20.884 --> 00:26:23.420
He saw the news and called.

00:26:24.954 --> 00:26:27.190
He said he’s coming back.

00:26:27.824 --> 00:26:28.658
So,

00:26:29.426 --> 00:26:30.660
I do have a guardian.

00:26:31.528 --> 00:26:32.529
I'll be fine.

00:26:33.329 --> 00:26:34.264
I lied.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.966
Surprisingly, she believed me.

00:26:38.201 --> 00:26:39.502
I didn’t have to go to the facility.

00:26:40.804 --> 00:26:44.074
After that, I received the suitcase
from the landlady.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.010
It seems she had just been
holding on to it for me.

00:26:48.478 --> 00:26:50.447
Then, when I opened it…

00:27:01.691 --> 00:27:02.525
One…

00:27:04.194 --> 00:27:05.028
two…

00:27:06.963 --> 00:27:08.131
three…

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.143
32 million 261 thousand and 570 yen…

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:22.045
ESTIMATED EMBEZZLED FUNDS 32,261,570 YEN

00:27:22.645 --> 00:27:26.416
For the time being, I buried the suitcase
in the yard, so no one would find it.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.985
For quite some time, the police

00:27:29.052 --> 00:27:31.654
and the child guidance people
would drop by to check on me,

00:27:32.288 --> 00:27:34.224
but I just pretended not to be home.

00:27:36.126 --> 00:27:38.628
Since my phone is cut off,

00:27:38.695 --> 00:27:40.830
this is the only place anyone
could find me.

00:27:41.965 --> 00:27:43.266
Not that anyone does.

00:27:44.934 --> 00:27:47.937
So, I kept living by myself,
making sure nobody knows about it.

00:27:48.004 --> 00:27:49.806
I even lied to my school

00:27:49.873 --> 00:27:52.308
-and went about my classes as usual, but…
-Here.

00:27:52.876 --> 00:27:53.977
We wrote this for you.

00:27:54.043 --> 00:27:55.311
WE’RE STILL FRIENDS!
EVERYONE LIKES YOU!

00:27:56.379 --> 00:27:57.213
-I don't want it.
-Why?

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.415
Just act like you usually do around me.

00:27:59.482 --> 00:28:01.618
-But we saw the news--
-I don't need it!

00:28:01.684 --> 00:28:03.853
-It's our heartfelt--
-I said I don't need it!

00:28:05.421 --> 00:28:07.824
Isn't that mean?

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.797
Everyone kept looking at me with pity,
and I really hated it.

00:28:14.931 --> 00:28:16.666
I feel at ease in Toyoko.

00:28:17.734 --> 00:28:19.002
I can talk about anything there.

00:28:19.936 --> 00:28:22.105
No one treats me like I’m different.

00:28:22.772 --> 00:28:26.376
When I told them that my mom
embezzled money, they just laughed it off.

00:28:26.876 --> 00:28:28.278
They found it amusing and wild.

00:28:29.045 --> 00:28:31.714
They didn’t put up walls
like the kids at school did.

00:28:31.781 --> 00:28:33.950
I felt comfortable there. But…

00:28:34.651 --> 00:28:38.354
with things like student-parent meetings,
and the meeting tomorrow,

00:28:38.421 --> 00:28:40.523
it’s getting harder without a dad lately.

00:28:41.224 --> 00:28:42.058
That’s why…

00:28:42.792 --> 00:28:44.727
I need someone to pretend to be my parent.

00:28:48.198 --> 00:28:49.933
That's the gist of my situation.

00:28:51.701 --> 00:28:54.070
Article Four. Payment.

00:28:54.904 --> 00:28:57.740
As compensation, Party A shall pay Party B

00:28:57.807 --> 00:28:59.843
32,261,570 yen

00:28:59.909 --> 00:29:02.045
for entering this contract.

00:29:03.413 --> 00:29:05.548
Article Five. Confidentiality.

00:29:05.615 --> 00:29:07.150
Both parties shall keep

00:29:07.217 --> 00:29:10.119
this contract strictly confidential

00:29:10.186 --> 00:29:13.523
and may not disclose it to any third party
without prior consent.

00:29:14.057 --> 00:29:16.326
Article Six. Promises.

00:29:16.993 --> 00:29:20.263
Both Party A and Party B
agree not to lie to each other.

00:29:21.231 --> 00:29:22.298
That’s all.

00:29:24.534 --> 00:29:25.668
PARTY A, PARTY B

00:29:25.735 --> 00:29:27.403
Please sign here.

00:29:28.605 --> 00:29:31.774
In any case, I just want to wait
for my mom here.

00:29:31.841 --> 00:29:34.744
I know she didn’t do it.
There must be a reason.

00:29:35.411 --> 00:29:37.280
It's just half a year more
until I graduate.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.751
I’ll take care of my own living.
I just need you to act the part sometimes.

00:29:42.919 --> 00:29:43.987
So, please.

00:29:49.359 --> 00:29:50.426
Hey…

00:29:51.027 --> 00:29:53.863
Even if you do manage
to graduate, what then?

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:54.931
I don't know.

00:29:54.998 --> 00:29:57.066
You can’t keep living alone here.

00:29:57.133 --> 00:29:58.034
I can!

00:29:59.636 --> 00:30:01.204
Playing pretend won’t last long.

00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:02.405
I'll make sure it does!

00:30:02.472 --> 00:30:06.743
You can wait for your mom, sure.
But there has to be another way.

00:30:07.944 --> 00:30:08.978
Is there?

00:30:13.883 --> 00:30:16.653
In any case, tomorrow,
let’s tell your teacher and the police

00:30:17.253 --> 00:30:19.789
-the truth, okay?
-Forget it. We're done here.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.824
Hey, wait!

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.009
I’VE LIKED YOU FOR A LONG TIME
MEET ME BEHIND THE GYM ON MONDAY

00:30:42.045 --> 00:30:43.246
ELECTRICITY: 3,762 YEN; GAS: 1,486 YEN

00:30:43.313 --> 00:30:44.547
WATER: 1,774 YEN
PHONE BILL, FOOD AND TRAIN FARE…

00:30:49.652 --> 00:30:51.087
-A minute ago…
-You were sleeping.

00:30:51.988 --> 00:30:53.156
Kusunoki.

00:30:54.123 --> 00:30:56.659
After class, come to the reception room
on the second floor.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.761
Okay.

00:31:01.331 --> 00:31:03.700
Did your dad say he'll be late?

00:31:09.439 --> 00:31:10.673
Sorry for being late.

00:31:11.174 --> 00:31:13.009
I couldn't quite find my way here.

00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:16.245
We've been expecting you.
This is police officer…

00:31:16.312 --> 00:31:17.780
I'm Matsu. Nice to meet you.

00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:21.117
Thank you

00:31:21.684 --> 00:31:23.820
-for taking care of my daughter.
-Huh?

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:28.391
Please have a seat.

00:31:30.126 --> 00:31:31.127
Thank you.

00:31:36.432 --> 00:31:39.669
Today, we’d like to go over
Hotaru’s future living arrangements

00:31:39.736 --> 00:31:42.405
and have you, her dad,
to review and confirm them.

00:31:42.472 --> 00:31:43.906
-Okay.
-Together with the school

00:31:43.973 --> 00:31:47.276
and the child guidance center,
we, as the police, want to coordinate

00:31:47.343 --> 00:31:49.645
and support her life going forward.

00:31:50.213 --> 00:31:51.414
Right.

00:31:51.481 --> 00:31:54.350
Please support Ms. Hotaru
until she's at the age to live on her own.

00:31:54.984 --> 00:31:56.486
-I understand.
-Okay.

00:31:56.552 --> 00:32:00.189
To start things off, could you please
tell us your name once again?

00:32:00.757 --> 00:32:02.291
Genichi Hatano.

00:32:02.992 --> 00:32:03.826
Oops…

00:32:04.327 --> 00:32:05.161
Hatano?

00:32:06.596 --> 00:32:10.433
That’s different from the name Ms. Hotaru
mentioned in the previous meeting.

00:32:12.201 --> 00:32:13.202
What's going on?

00:32:15.471 --> 00:32:16.506
Uh…

00:32:18.508 --> 00:32:21.744
That’s my name after remarriage.

00:32:21.811 --> 00:32:23.312
Your first name is different too.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.282
Didn’t you say, "Genichi"?

00:32:29.318 --> 00:32:33.056
I m-misspoke. That’s… Well, um…

00:32:34.991 --> 00:32:35.892
my stage name.

00:32:35.958 --> 00:32:37.693
-Stage name?
-What?

00:32:38.594 --> 00:32:42.799
Yes. I used to aim to be a musician.

00:32:43.299 --> 00:32:46.269
I didn't manage to debut, but I was close.

00:32:46.335 --> 00:32:49.605
Sometimes I still use that name.

00:32:49.672 --> 00:32:51.607
It kinda stuck with me.

00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:55.211
Besides, in name fortune-telling,

00:32:55.278 --> 00:32:58.114
"Genichi Hatano" supposedly brings
better luck, so…

00:32:59.582 --> 00:33:02.652
-Wait, so your real name is different?
-Oh,

00:33:02.718 --> 00:33:03.653
my real name?

00:33:03.719 --> 00:33:04.687
It's…

00:33:09.692 --> 00:33:12.128
Jin Ichigaya.

00:33:14.464 --> 00:33:15.765
Mr. Jin Ichigaya…

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.068
Your stage name is Genichi Hatano?

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.441
True, it has a ring to it.

00:33:28.111 --> 00:33:30.580
But Jin Ichigaya

00:33:30.646 --> 00:33:32.615
also sounds like
a talented actor's name, right?

00:33:32.682 --> 00:33:34.684
-Well, yeah…
-Right?

00:33:36.085 --> 00:33:37.520
You're hurting Dad's feelings.

00:33:38.221 --> 00:33:39.355
I'm sorry.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:43.693
And what's the status between you
and her mom, Tomoe Kusunoki?

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.996
When she was nine,

00:33:47.063 --> 00:33:49.665
we divorced, and I haven’t seen her since.

00:33:50.166 --> 00:33:52.135
And both of you are now living together.

00:33:53.436 --> 00:33:54.737
Yes, that's right.

00:33:55.671 --> 00:33:58.074
As to why you hadn’t been in touch
all this time,

00:33:58.141 --> 00:33:59.742
was there perhaps some reason?

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.845
I just wasn't aware of anything,

00:34:02.912 --> 00:34:05.481
whether about the case

00:34:05.548 --> 00:34:06.849
or about what was going on.

00:34:07.517 --> 00:34:09.752
But she told me everything.

00:34:11.687 --> 00:34:14.524
Even the painful things,
she shared it all…

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.226
So, I want her

00:34:17.927 --> 00:34:20.396
to focus not on daily stuff, meals,

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:23.099
or even money,

00:34:24.167 --> 00:34:27.436
but on what she likes, who she likes…

00:34:27.503 --> 00:34:31.140
I want her to be preoccupied
with things like that as much as possible.

00:34:31.774 --> 00:34:32.775
That’s why

00:34:34.277 --> 00:34:35.311
I decided

00:34:36.045 --> 00:34:38.414
to be a father to her.

00:34:39.348 --> 00:34:42.451
One more time, I mean.

00:34:43.019 --> 00:34:44.020
Very well.

00:34:45.221 --> 00:34:47.056
So, her daily life seems fine.

00:34:48.824 --> 00:34:52.261
Next, a few questions about the case.

00:34:55.031 --> 00:34:56.399
I'll go get my bag from class.

00:35:00.336 --> 00:35:01.837
I'll be taking my leave now.

00:35:02.338 --> 00:35:04.807
-I’ll see you to the exit.
-Thank you. It's fine.

00:35:04.874 --> 00:35:05.942
Well then.

00:35:09.912 --> 00:35:11.747
I didn't know Hatano was your stage name.

00:35:14.016 --> 00:35:16.419
Oh, sorry.

00:35:17.153 --> 00:35:19.855
But you can still call me Hatano. Ah…

00:35:20.856 --> 00:35:21.824
Sorry.

00:35:22.892 --> 00:35:25.328
Um, so now, where are you…

00:35:26.629 --> 00:35:28.764
Spending the night in your car, I meant.

00:35:30.132 --> 00:35:31.767
At a roadside station.

00:35:35.071 --> 00:35:38.241
Hotaru told me everything.

00:35:38.307 --> 00:35:39.242
I see.

00:35:40.142 --> 00:35:44.513
I thought I’d play the role of her dad.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.582
Sure, I'll leave things to you.

00:35:46.649 --> 00:35:48.618
What, you're not going to stop me?

00:35:48.684 --> 00:35:49.619
Do you want me to?

00:35:50.152 --> 00:35:54.190
‎Well, I’m doing something
‎I probably shouldn’t, right?

00:35:54.257 --> 00:35:55.691
Yeah, pretty much.

00:35:55.758 --> 00:35:56.859
Right?

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.496
-But you've already decided, right?
-Yes.

00:36:00.563 --> 00:36:02.732
-Good evening.
-Hello.

00:36:03.366 --> 00:36:05.468
This is her middle school
homeroom teacher, Mr. Sakuta.

00:36:05.534 --> 00:36:07.637
I'm the landlady, Inokashira.

00:36:07.703 --> 00:36:10.506
I'm Sakuta. Sorry for the sudden request.

00:36:10.573 --> 00:36:11.741
No worries.

00:36:11.807 --> 00:36:14.610
I'd appreciate it if you'd allow me
to park my car here for a while.

00:36:14.677 --> 00:36:16.545
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

00:36:19.015 --> 00:36:20.650
Sorry about this all of the sudden.

00:36:21.584 --> 00:36:22.418
Not at all.

00:36:22.918 --> 00:36:24.387
You don't have to sleep in your car.

00:36:24.887 --> 00:36:26.856
We have plenty of vacant rooms.

00:36:27.923 --> 00:36:28.824
-She's right.
-Oh, no.

00:36:28.891 --> 00:36:32.528
Living in the same building
as a student would be a little…

00:36:32.595 --> 00:36:36.832
Then, feel free to use the yard.

00:36:36.899 --> 00:36:37.867
Thank you.

00:36:37.933 --> 00:36:39.769
-Well then.
-See you.

00:36:42.738 --> 00:36:45.975
Sorry about this. Once I find a place,
I’ll move out immediately.

00:36:46.042 --> 00:36:47.109
No rush.

00:36:47.943 --> 00:36:49.712
Oh, and your lost item.

00:36:50.212 --> 00:36:51.947
I'm talking about your Santa sock.

00:36:53.215 --> 00:36:55.551
I tried searching for it,
but it was nowhere to be found.

00:36:55.618 --> 00:36:56.852
It's important to you, right?

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.921
-I'll try looking for it again.
-Sorry.

00:36:59.422 --> 00:37:01.691
I already found it.

00:37:03.159 --> 00:37:05.594
Oh, I see. That's great.

00:37:05.661 --> 00:37:07.697
-I'll be heading back.
-Okay.

00:37:08.764 --> 00:37:09.598
See you.

00:37:16.005 --> 00:37:17.039
See you.

00:37:22.211 --> 00:37:23.045
See you.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:29.418
May I come in?

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.562
Why did you introduce him to this place?

00:37:41.697 --> 00:37:43.132
He seemed troubled.

00:37:43.199 --> 00:37:46.001
If he finds out I live upstairs,
it’ll be bad.

00:37:46.502 --> 00:37:49.004
Oh, right.

00:37:49.071 --> 00:37:51.040
Don't give me that.

00:37:51.107 --> 00:37:52.308
I'm sorry.

00:37:53.642 --> 00:37:56.145
-Hey, do you want to eat?
-No.

00:37:58.381 --> 00:38:01.851
Come to think about it, isn't it weird
that gays have kids to begin with?

00:38:03.085 --> 00:38:05.020
No, some people are married to women too.

00:38:07.189 --> 00:38:09.325
And the stage name part…

00:38:10.226 --> 00:38:12.328
I pulled that off pretty slick, didn't I?

00:38:12.395 --> 00:38:14.029
That was really forced.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:17.867
Also, how did you even know my dad's name…

00:38:19.135 --> 00:38:22.204
or the details of his divorce?

00:38:22.271 --> 00:38:25.374
I thought they’d ask,

00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:27.777
so I memorized everything in the notebook.

00:38:28.711 --> 00:38:31.647
So, does that mean you agree
to the contract?

00:38:31.714 --> 00:38:33.616
Just to be clear, I don’t need the money.

00:38:33.682 --> 00:38:35.618
-That's not negotiable.
-What?

00:38:35.684 --> 00:38:38.120
A contract needs to have consideration.

00:38:38.187 --> 00:38:40.423
I really don't need it.

00:38:41.257 --> 00:38:43.793
You can just hold on to it for now.

00:38:44.326 --> 00:38:45.227
Huh?

00:38:45.795 --> 00:38:47.029
PARTY A, PARTY B

00:38:47.096 --> 00:38:48.998
Okay then, sign here.

00:38:58.774 --> 00:39:00.709
PARTY A: HOTARU KUSUNOKI
PARTY B: GENICHI HATANO

00:39:03.846 --> 00:39:04.680
What kind of house are you buying?

00:39:05.748 --> 00:39:06.749
Not buying.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:10.019
I can choose not to use it, right?

00:39:10.519 --> 00:39:11.554
Well, yeah.

00:39:12.755 --> 00:39:16.292
Okay now, I’ll whip up something simple.

00:39:21.597 --> 00:39:24.467
Right away, there's something
I need advice from you as my dad.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.001
What is it?

00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:30.206
CAREER SHEET

00:39:30.272 --> 00:39:31.740
I've got to submit this.

00:39:31.807 --> 00:39:33.242
Haven't you filled it up already?

00:39:34.577 --> 00:39:36.178
I'm not sure what to write.

00:39:36.979 --> 00:39:39.148
-Any high school you'd like to go to?
-No.

00:39:40.316 --> 00:39:42.952
Are there any jobs you'd like to do then?

00:39:43.018 --> 00:39:43.953
No.

00:39:47.423 --> 00:39:50.226
Why did you quit being a musician?

00:39:51.594 --> 00:39:52.428
Here.

00:39:53.128 --> 00:39:55.931
You were good enough to debut, right?

00:39:55.998 --> 00:39:59.502
It wasn’t because I was good at singing.
It was because I was gay.

00:40:01.604 --> 00:40:03.672
They wanted me to sing
in a tight tank top,

00:40:03.739 --> 00:40:06.308
speaking all campy, like I never do.

00:40:06.876 --> 00:40:09.144
They said it wouldn’t
be newsworthy enough otherwise.

00:40:09.745 --> 00:40:11.113
If I hadn’t refused,

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:13.349
maybe I could’ve become
a professional musician.

00:40:17.319 --> 00:40:19.722
-Do you have any more shishamo?
-What, you want more?

00:40:20.389 --> 00:40:23.759
No, let’s send it to the person
who said that.

00:40:23.826 --> 00:40:26.195
And tell them that they don’t have
to poke holes in it.

00:40:26.262 --> 00:40:28.197
A shishamo bomb. Let's send it to them.

00:40:30.266 --> 00:40:32.601
Even I know that’s a mean thing to say.

00:40:35.237 --> 00:40:37.172
You don't have to do that for me.

00:40:38.774 --> 00:40:40.943
Have you come to hate singing?

00:40:44.747 --> 00:40:46.081
I’ve always loved it.

00:40:47.049 --> 00:40:49.151
I thought about quitting.

00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:53.556
Every time I see my guitar,
it reminds me of that tight tank top,

00:40:53.622 --> 00:40:54.723
and it's annoying.

00:40:55.724 --> 00:40:59.295
But eventually, I realized that singing

00:41:00.629 --> 00:41:02.097
is something I still loved.

00:41:02.798 --> 00:41:04.700
That’s what love feels like, I guess.

00:41:05.401 --> 00:41:06.735
What's that?

00:41:06.802 --> 00:41:09.738
I guess I’m just thinking
about it unconsciously…

00:41:10.272 --> 00:41:12.007
It feels like living the moment together.

00:41:13.409 --> 00:41:16.812
I can’t go back
to who I was before meeting them.

00:41:17.813 --> 00:41:18.747
Something like that.

00:41:20.649 --> 00:41:22.117
What are we talking about?

00:41:23.452 --> 00:41:24.553
Who's them?

00:41:27.156 --> 00:41:28.157
Sorry, my bad.

00:41:29.191 --> 00:41:30.726
Do you have someone you like?

00:41:32.127 --> 00:41:32.962
No…

00:41:35.431 --> 00:41:36.465
Why do you ask?

00:41:37.099 --> 00:41:38.200
No reason.

00:41:39.068 --> 00:41:41.236
-Maybe Santa Claus?
-Yeah, right.

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.941
Oh, no, no!

00:41:46.008 --> 00:41:47.276
Really?

00:41:47.343 --> 00:41:48.644
What's with that?

00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:51.647
How nice of you to have
a lot of things you love.

00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:56.318
I don’t have any, and I don’t understand.

00:41:56.986 --> 00:41:57.820
You’ll find it.

00:41:59.221 --> 00:42:01.357
-Are you sure?
-Eventually. That's for sure.

00:42:02.024 --> 00:42:03.225
One or two things,

00:42:04.159 --> 00:42:05.127
definitely.

00:42:31.787 --> 00:42:32.821
I’VE LIKED YOU FOR A LONG TIME

00:42:32.888 --> 00:42:33.722
MEET ME AFTER SCHOOL ON MONDAY

00:42:33.789 --> 00:42:35.591
I forgot about this.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.168
Oh man.

00:42:47.469 --> 00:42:48.771
This is Saku's…

00:42:50.439 --> 00:42:52.441
After the beep tone,

00:42:52.508 --> 00:42:55.044
please leave your name and message.

00:42:56.078 --> 00:42:58.247
Hello, Mom? You've gotta hear this.

00:42:58.747 --> 00:43:01.817
My future self is always something

00:43:01.884 --> 00:43:03.452
I've never been able to imagine.

00:43:03.519 --> 00:43:05.521
Like myself in high school.

00:43:06.021 --> 00:43:07.456
Or working…

00:43:10.659 --> 00:43:12.394
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:43:13.762 --> 00:43:16.065
-What?
-I forgot to submit this yesterday.

00:43:16.799 --> 00:43:18.033
-Okay.
-But

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.202
my future self finding something
that I love

00:43:20.269 --> 00:43:22.671
is what I could slightly imagine.

00:43:23.272 --> 00:43:24.740
It sounds pretty fulfilling, huh?

00:43:26.208 --> 00:43:28.610
Did you ever have something
you loved, Mom?

00:43:29.111 --> 00:43:30.646
Something you wanted to do?

00:43:31.246 --> 00:43:32.581
Tell me when you return, yeah?

00:43:33.282 --> 00:43:34.483
Okay, bye.

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:37.252
-This is my first time!
-That you reeled in a fish?

00:43:37.319 --> 00:43:38.353
No, fishing itself.

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:40.622
You're missing out on life!

00:43:40.689 --> 00:43:41.757
This is really fun!

00:43:42.825 --> 00:43:44.326
I think I might like it.

00:43:44.393 --> 00:43:45.461
Here goes!

00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:48.163
You dropped this.

00:43:49.064 --> 00:43:50.099
You dropped this!

00:43:52.901 --> 00:43:53.936
Thank you.

00:43:56.705 --> 00:43:58.207
Embezzlement of 30 million yen?

00:43:58.841 --> 00:44:00.976
A female employee is currently on the run.

00:45:52.154 --> 00:45:54.122
