[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.950
[Episode 6]

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.590
Mom.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.200
The meat is ready.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.350
Mom, I'm back.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.009
Let's eat first.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.350
Mom, is that the smell of meat?

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.350
It smells so good.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.000
Your father sold some things

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.080
to get this.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.080
What else do we have left at home?

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.150
Here, have a steamed bun.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.840
You should try it.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.620
You should eat too.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.890
Enjoy this meal.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.840
Thank you, Mom. You're so kind.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.910
I'll go wash the clothes
after I finish eating.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.290
Add a bit more.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.910
Just a little more.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.790
That's enough. Enough.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.310
I've offered you plenty already.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.400
Yet you're still not satisfied?

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.329
There's no more.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.450
Add two more jin of pork.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.630
I raised my girl

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.360
with great difficulty.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.590
You raised your girl?

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.660
Everyone knows you found her abandoned.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.390
One more jin.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.630
That's itâ€”no more.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.760
O-One and a half jin.

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:58.980
If that's not acceptable,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.380
find someone else for your ghost marriage.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.610
Why are you here?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160
Dad.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.000
Why did you come?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.520
Why do you want to sell me?

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.630
I'm very obedient.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.710
I'll always be good.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.500
Girl.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.400
Don't blame us.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.070
Don't blame us.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.800
We thought it was just about

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.750
a matter of adding one more set of dishes
at home.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.750
So we kept you as a child bride.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.170
But these are troubled times.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.690
Enough, say no more.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.640
If we don't sell her,
the whole family will starve.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.880
One jin it is.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.470
Take the girl with you.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.910
Girl!

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.470
Look... Well...

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.520
Girl!

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.480
Master.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.280
What?

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.310
Are you still upset

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.750
with my fellows?

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.540
Not really.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.390
I know

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.670
they're not cowards.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.070
They are indeed cowards.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.890
Don't take it personally.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.209
However,

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.410
you should still be respectful.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.160
Master,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.410
Sword King Yu

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.120
is truly suspicious.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.430
I'm worried that Mr. Tang

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.160
might be in danger going alone.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.830
I know.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.690
Walk with me?

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.270
Because my fellows

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.310
are afraid of Sword King Yu,

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.440
even if we ask them to investigate,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.290
they won't find anything.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.890
What should we do then?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.750
Therefore,

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.270
I need to find someone

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.159
who doesn't fear Sword King
and is brave yet careful

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.430
and capable

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.180
to investigate the truth
for the Sword Alliance.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.430
So this person is...

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.280
[Sword Duel Festival]

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.310
This is an invitation
to the Sword Duel Festival

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.370
sent to the Sword Alliance
from Sword King City.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.390
I need to attend to other matters.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.270
You will represent the Sword Alliance

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.800
on a trip to Sword King City.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.720
You truly have a keen eye for detail.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.580
Be respectful.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.920
If you go alone,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.380
I'll worry about you.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.630
Zhong.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.930
Sword Master.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.260
Here, I'm leaving this to you.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.560
Okay.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.800
Master.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:38.650
Sword Master.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.640
Umbrella.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.720
Umbrella!

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.430
I excel in martial arts.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.120
I don't mind this light rain.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.630
Zhong,

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.040
what's going on?

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.040
How many times have I told you?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.170
Don't call me Zhong.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.770
Call me Ms. Zhong instead.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.600
I'm sorry, Zhong.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.310
What did Master just tell you?

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.970
Master said

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.560
you should accompany me
to Sword King City.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.490
Sword King City?

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.120
Chi.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.040
We've added charcoal twice already.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.560
What about your fish?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.310
Just a moment.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.270
It's about to...

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.600
Foxy Tang, what do you mean?

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.900
Are you blaming me
for not catching any fish?

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.330
I just have a sore throat.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.500
You're being too sensitive.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.270
You're lurking there like a dark lump.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.120
You scared away the fish

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.450
that just took the bait.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.510
That idle guy

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.800
in there

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.860
is your new master.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.850
If you starve him to death,

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.330
you'll be guilty of killing your master.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.270
Nice skills.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.190
If I'd known you had such talent,

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:18.720
I wouldn't have wasted

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.190
my time fishing here.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.720
One, two, three.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.560
Only three fish.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.560
We need one more.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.800
I think

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.270
this quiet fellow has a bad temper.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.270
He lost the fight,

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.630
and now he's sulking.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.720
Shen, aren't you coming aboard?

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.710
We don't share the same path,

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.570
nor are we the same kind of people.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.850
I've never planned to help you.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.430
Why should we be in the same boat?

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.750
Foxy Tang.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.680
Didn't see that coming, did you?

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.750
All that effort to break into the tower

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:50.810
is all for nothing.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.200
Slippery-Scaled Fish with Colored Fins.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.530
This is the most delicious fish
in the Yan River.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.510
It only needs to be grilled
without seasoning

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.770
to be truly exquisite.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:05.720
Shei.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.240
I'll go grill the fish now.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.630
Wait.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.200
The stove smoke is thick.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.920
Use this.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.040
What's this?

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.390
Bixiao Pearl.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.860
Rub it to make fire
without causing smoke or dust.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.870
Wear it on your body,

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.070
and it can ward off cold and protect you.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.310
More importantly...

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.490
What a treasure!

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.850
Where did you get it?

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.270
Shadow Concealment Technique.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:36.929
Be careful!

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.390
Shen.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.240
I'm not asking you to kill anyone,

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.370
but to find someone.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.060
You want me to enter Sword King City?

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.850
I want you to take the Bixiao Pearl.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.750
With his Shadow Concealment Technique
at this level,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.270
there's no place

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.670
in this world he can't go.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.770
No wonder you asked for his help.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.870
He should've just told us
that he wanted money,

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.690
instead of causing so much trouble,

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:32.910
and so should Dieban Chonghua.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.810
Why didn't they just tell us directly?

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.070
You're wrong, Chi Yun.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.330
Shen doesn't want silver.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.150
He wants the gems

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.350
from the Seven-Treasure Jade Hairpin.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.590
This hairpin was once a royal treasure.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.240
It contains

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.670
7 priceless jade pearls.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.200
Bixiao Pearl is one of them.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.550
Many people at that time followed suit,

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.000
and the hairpin became quite popular.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.750
When Yique Yinyang created chaos,

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.980
it was accidentally lost.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.860
Someone dismantled and sold it.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.340
Since then,

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.960
the 7 treasures
have been scattered everywhere.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.550
They're not only hard to find

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.240
but also difficult to authenticate.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.870
However,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.930
the one I possess is genuine.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.480
Who are you explaining this to?

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.600
I happen to know

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.240
that you are

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.900
searching for these 7 pearls.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.050
As long as you agree to help me,

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.240
I

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.460
will likewise promise you

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.040
to fulfill your heart's desire.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.000
I have 2 wishes.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.510
Compared to
the Seven-Treasure Jade Hairpin,

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.590
I'm more interested in the second one.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.620
As long as you agree to my request,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.600
I

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.190
will certainly fulfill my end completely.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.550
I've been wanting

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.720
to ask you something for a long time, Sir.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.440
Since it's pitch dark

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.870
here in this cave,

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:15.550
why do you

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:17.990
still keep your eyes closed?

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.530
If I open my eyes,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.930
I'll be tempted to look around.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.410
The deeper one is in darkness,

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.210
the more one craves for light.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.440
You make a good point.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.670
Then why don't you light a lamp?

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.000
If guests come, well...

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.600
I'd still need to close my eyes
even with a lamp lit.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.130
So why bother lighting one?

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.240
I can't argue with that.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.150
So, Sir, what are you dissatisfied with

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.200
about the room

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.260
the Sword Alliance prepared for you?

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.670
Why must you stay up in the mountains?

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.800
It's crowded there.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.840
You save people,
yet dislike being around them.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.240
Such compassion indeed.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.160
Alright.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.010
I'll cut to the chase.
I have urgent matters.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.200
We've been investigating

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.660
the Blood Ghost Pill case.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.320
Every time we find a lead,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.920
it always breaks off midway.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.910
This time,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.730
I have new information.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.840
This is what my disciple Zhong Chunjie

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.690
uncovered while investigating

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.120
the Hao family massacre.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:17.870
Tang Lici.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.750
Yu Qifeng.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:20.940
Yanmen.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.550
A crucial route for imperial transport

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.260
and a skyway for messenger geese.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.790
That makes sense.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.150
Your disciple brought back
2 pieces of evidence.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.000
If Yu Qifeng

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.480
has truly gone down a dark path,

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.790
using the imperial transport route

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.790
to control the spread of poison pills

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.200
and attempting
to take over Yanmen's air route,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.130
I'm afraid soon,

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.840
he'll bring disaster
to the entire jianghu.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.120
Even if he's the foremost swordsman
in the land,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.250
he must be wiped out.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.170
But without evidence,

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.030
we can't arrest him.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.550
Sword King City

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.440
has deep control over the jianghu.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.220
The 5 Schools and 18 Sects
around Mount Tai

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.900
all follow Yu Qifeng's lead.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.270
If we want to investigate this matter,

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.240
I'm afraid we'll face many difficulties.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.500
Besides Sword King Yu,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.020
there's another person

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.420
I'm concerned about too.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.270
Tang Lici.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.410
Exactly.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.440
The death of Fang Zhou
from the Zhoudi Tower

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.360
is likely

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.510
connected to him.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.750
I understand your concerns.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.150
These 2 cases

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.150
were solved by Chunji

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.790
under his guidance.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.230
But at the same time,

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.940
someone saw him killing people
along the way.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.630
It's said

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.570
his martial arts skills
are incredibly profound and mysterious.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.240
It seems

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.270
you quite admire him.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.560
I admit

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.720
that I admire his intelligence.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.950
But whether he's righteous or evil,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.410
I can't say for certain.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:39.750
I suspect

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.180
that he's using the lives
of those involved

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.310
as part of his scheme

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.740
to draw out the mastermind behind it all.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.180
The arrangement at Buhuan Tower

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.510
is fraught with danger.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.810
Even if this person
doesn't commit evil deeds,

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.410
he's still not a good person.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.500
I will make a trip to Sword King City.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.790
Feel free to investigate the truth.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.810
But his life,

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.200
I'm afraid, can't be left

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.080
in the hands of the jianghu people.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.140
You've forgotten.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.220
I'm not one of them.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.950
To collect all 7 treasures of the hairpin,

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.480
even though you are

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.540
the top assassin of the Shisan Tower,

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.690
it would still be nearly impossible.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.550
When a person has nothing,

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.130
they discover they're capable of anything.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.240
You haven't asked me

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.500
what my second wish is.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.510
Why don't you ask me

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.680
how I can help fulfill your wish?

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.570
My second wish:

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.060
I want to kill someone.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.480
It's Chief's order?

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.150
It has nothing to do
with the Shisan Tower.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.550
It's my personal matter.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.920
In the jianghu,
you're known as Soul Breaker Shen.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.480
Rumor has it

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.720
that besides

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.870
your sword whip,

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.630
you possess a secret realm technique

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.090
that can trap enemies
in their inner demons.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.320
Why didn't you use it today?

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.270
Today,

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.330
I aimed to take the pearl, not to kill.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.150
What if I want to see it?

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.480
If I'm not mistaken,

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.210
the person you want to kill

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.840
is a master
who possesses the Rebirth Scroll.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.150
Don't you want to know

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.080
if your secret technique

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.430
can defeat

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.600
the heir of the Rebirth Scroll?

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.870
Then you'd better be careful.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.250
Martial Realm.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.000
Blood Moon Heart Slayer.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.080
You're one lucky man.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.600
You've joined the tower
for just one month,

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.550
and Senior is throwing

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.810
a celebration for you.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:48.840
Time to eat.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:57.190
How dare you threaten me, little monster?
Come with me.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.180
Such strength.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.790
I don't believe it.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.380
Yan.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.230
What's going on here?

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:10.750
Senior, look at him.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:24.270
So,

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.630
have you gotten used to living here
this month?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.130
Still not speaking?

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.740
Senior, just leave him be.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.430
He's been here a month

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.560
and won't make a sound, no matter what.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:39.580
Alright.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:40.920
Come.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.250
Let's sit down.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.100
You still haven't told us

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.350
what your name is.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.750
Tang.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:55.110
Tang?

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.590
And your given name?

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.770
Perhaps you've forgotten?

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.350
Well then,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.640
we'll have to

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.840
give you a name first.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:09.200
Yan,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.460
do you have any good ideas?

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.650
Let me think.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:15.640
Mute Tang.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:17.820
Quiet Tang.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.030
Sweet and Sour Spareribs.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:23.830
That won't do.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.000
I will get hungry

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.240
every time I call him.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.420
Candied hawthorns.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.050
Food again.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.580
Fu, you're leading me astray.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.640
Ajibanr.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:36.670
Tang Jia.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.990
Ajibanr Tang Jia?

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.420
Is this ancient Sanskrit?

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.400
What are you talking about?

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.860
I don't quite understand.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.030
We're discussing

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.720
that I want to teach him to read first,

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:55.600
then teach him our martial arts,

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.000
â™ª No one passes, and flowers fall â™ª

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.840
so he can become a disciple
of the Zhoudi Tower.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.310
â™ª It's just like a trip coming and going â™ª

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.790
I wonder

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.740
if you're willing.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.630
â™ª Guests at door, no joy or grief â™ª

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.350
â™ª Bodhi sprouts between the brows â™ª

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:09.880
â™ª I've come, yet you're not here â™ª

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.680
Martial arts.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.840
â™ª Only wind and rain â™ª

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.110
â™ª Mountain path ends,
and soft wind blows â™ª

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.440
No.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.400
â™ª Clouds gone, night quiet,
birds sing alone â™ª

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.680
I won't learn martial arts.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.140
I can't.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.370
â™ª On the endless cold night â™ª

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.320
You have strong inner strength,

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:25.550
â™ª Strange is but the crescent moon â™ª

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.850
and your strikes are fast and precise.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.070
Who would believe
you can't do martial arts?

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.230
â™ª The flute fades far away â™ª

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.860
Besides, like Yan,

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.140
â™ª What's familiar will also change â™ª

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.800
I also want a junior disciple.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.920
â™ª Ice melts in palms â™ª

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.830
I don't.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.910
â™ª Hands warm a soul â™ª

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.410
â™ª Dream of you once,
and miss you 10,000 times â™ª

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720
â™ª Spring sounds break,
and dreams never wake â™ª

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.270
So,

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.130
are you willing to give it a try?

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.440
â™ª Echoes sink in silent surges â™ª

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.770
Actually, martial arts

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.340
aren't just weapons for hurting others.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.750
â™ª Surpassing many words â™ª

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.550
One day,

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.280
you will use them

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:57.160
â™ª On the way back, a half-lit oil lamp â™ª

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.890
to protect what matters to you.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.830
â™ª Wet ink stains surge and overflow â™ª

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:02.510
Protect

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.790
â™ª Hope what's hopeful,
and let go of anger in a day â™ª

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:05.590
what matters.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:16.350
â™ª Yearn for what's yearnable,
live up to it, and never let you go â™ª

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.350
â™ª Listen to the rain â™ª

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.860
â™ª Whispering nonstop in my ears â™ª

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:25.130
â™ª Wake, the cloud in dreams â™ª

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.400
"One of a kind in a millennium;

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:26.880
â™ª Can't hide the stars in my eyes â™ª

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.160
break with old words."

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.790
Then let's call you

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.480
â™ª Broken promises made â™ª

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.440
Tang Lici.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.810
â™ª Burning fire â™ª

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.290
â™ª The merciful Buddha â™ª

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.920
â™ª All are seen through â™ª

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.070
The Chicken Soup with Bamboo Shoot
is here.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.140
Let me see.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.030
â™ª Shine even as I fall â™ª

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:41.760
Junior Lici.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.440
Here.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.190
I...

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.340
Fu, let's drink too.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.220
I'll pour the wine.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:08.960
Here.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.220
You both trained under the same master.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.070
Shadow Concealment Killing.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:31.670
Floating Light Like Dreams.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.040
Fang Zhou,

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.060
I've never understood

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.240
why things have to come to this.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:03.480
â™ª Facing swords and blades, I roar alone â™ª

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.200
Tang Lici,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.040
I wish I could
cut you into a thousand pieces!

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:12.070
â™ª With supreme power,
I roam free under heaven â™ª

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.570
â™ª Mad and laughing
like Buddha or a demon â™ª

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.070
â™ª A roar, and winds and clouds howl â™ª

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.820
â™ª No madness, no fire â™ª

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.320
â™ª How can one be called a hero? â™ª

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:28.200
Now,

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.900
it's my turn to hear

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.450
what kind of story you have.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.880
He can copy my martial arts technique.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:53.830
â™ª Facing swords and blades, I roar alone â™ª

00:22:54.230 --> 00:23:00.310
â™ª With supreme power,
I roam free under heaven â™ª

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.100
â™ª Mad and laughing
like Buddha or a demon â™ª

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.350
â™ª A roar, and winds and clouds howl â™ª

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.560
â™ª Behold the land, miles wide â™ª

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.940
â™ª Where rolling waves surge â™ª

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:19.060
â™ª Facing swords and blades, I roar alone â™ª

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:25.620
â™ª With supreme power,
I roam free under heaven â™ª

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.110
â™ª Mad and laughing
like Buddha or a demon â™ª

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.620
â™ª A roar, and winds and clouds howl â™ª

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.360
â™ª No madness, no fire â™ª

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.210
â™ª How can one be called a hero? â™ª

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.200
Seven-Treasure Jade Hairpin.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.800
Unfortunately, just like its disguise,

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.160
it's nothing but an ugly counterfeit.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.200
This life-extending pill,
however, is genuine.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.030
Do you know

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.790
that this tiny pill

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.170
came from healers
who tasted countless herbs

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.400
and tested poisons on themselves

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.240
countless times,

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.570
barely surviving to create this miracle?

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:12.680
And yet you put it

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.590
inside this disgusting fake.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.930
Someone like you

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.610
doesn't deserve the life-extending pill.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.190
So it's all for a woman.

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:01.200
Your eyes

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.000
look so innocent yet stubborn.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:06.750
The more I look,
the more you remind me of him.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.310
I've changed my mind.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.050
I knew someone

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.270
who was somewhat similar to you.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.460
He appeared sincere and innocent.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.200
He used these qualities

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.480
to gain your trust,

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.070
then revealed his venomous true nature.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.260
He mercilessly

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.930
took away your loved ones

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:27.990
and best friends

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.950
and destroyed everything you had.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.000
Likewise, today,

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.880
we met by chance

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.640
as total strangers,

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.100
yet I'm treating you this way.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.400
Is it

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.240
cruel?

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.070
The hatred between us

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.720
is too deep to be washed away

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.250
by all the rivers.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:11.400
Yan.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.530
If there is true justice in this world,

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.070
let me

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:30.070
kill that monster with my own hands.

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.590
Buddhist Abbot,

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.400
what defines karma?

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:49.120
The doer sows the cause;

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.310
the receiver reaps the effect.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.020
If someone kills because of me,

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.040
if innocents suffer because of me,

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.320
does that make it my karma?

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.590
On the third day of the ninth lunar month,

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.510
purchased tea leaves and liquor.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.570
On the 15th day
of the ninth lunar month...

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.240
The 15th day of the ninth lunar month

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.040
is the 35th day
since my foster father passed away.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.240
â™ª Nothing to love â™ª

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:53.160
â™ª Nothing to lose â™ª

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:53.720
Huiniang and I

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.320
spent a short time together.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.410
We had no money.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.400
But we were happy.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.480
I want to play too.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:15.160
Yeah.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.560
â™ª I cross the Yan River in the wasteland â™ª

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.110
â™ª Singing a long, unfinished song â™ª

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:32.510
Isn't this one prettier?

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.920
As long as you like it.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:35.510
â™ª The full moon and a few shining stars â™ª

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.320
Huiniang had a terminal illness.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.110
To save her,

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.840
I joined the Shisan Tower.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.100
â™ª Look down on my dream â™ª

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:40.700
Huiniang.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.000
Huiniang.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.050
Dieban Chonghua's condition

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.020
was that for 5 years,

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.110
I couldn't see Huiniang.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:56.460
â™ª The breeze blows through the pleats â™ª

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:03.530
â™ª Water polishes the old ruts â™ª

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:04.590
What Chief demands

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.550
has always been

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:08.150
a price others can't afford.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:09.790
To save Huiniang,

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:12.290
I served the Shisan Tower for 5 years.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:13.960
Four years ago,

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.450
when my contract
with the Shisan Tower ended,

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.680
full of joy,

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:19.550
I left with the life-extending pill

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.960
that could save Huiniang

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.110
from the tower.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.490
But by the Yellow River,

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:27.590
I met that person.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.740
That person
destroyed the life-extending pill.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.590
And it was

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.320
because of the lack of this pill

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.850
that Huiniang died.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:58.370
It's really you.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.000
â™ª The breeze blows through the pleats â™ª

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.160
You're back.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:04.840
Yes, it's me. I'm back.

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:14.400
â™ª Water polishes the old ruts â™ª

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.000
Huiniang.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.310
Huiniang.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.590
Huiniang!

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:22.080
Huiniang!

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.550
â™ª Trapped in the loop of loneliness â™ª

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:24.440
Huiniang died,

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.080
and my heart died with her.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:28.310
What remains

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:30.070
is Shen Langhun seeking revenge

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:31.830
like a vengeful ghost.

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:34.320
For revenge,

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.090
I returned to the Shisan Tower,

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.430
just to ask him to tell me

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.560
who my enemy was.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:44.110
This time,

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:47.400
what price did he demand?

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.300
Huiniang's body.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.310
I gave Huiniang's body

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.820
to the tower for safekeeping.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.110
Dieban Chonghua

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.050
sealed her in a crystal jade coffin.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.200
So I could see her often.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.720
But every time I see her,

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.200
it reminds me

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.930
that I couldn't save Huiniang.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:15.880
I recognize

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.250
your martial arts style

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.480
is the same as his.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.730
The power of the Rebirth Scroll
he possesses

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.460
was stolen from me.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.400
Who is that person?

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.160
Where is he?

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.080
Before,

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.750
his name was Liu Yan.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:49.960
He was my friend.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.830
Now,

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.350
he is the master of the Fengliu Shop.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:31:59.370
He's also my enemy.

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:01.470
I don't care

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:02.420
where he's been

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.390
or what he's done these 4 years.

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.230
But next,

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.000
he will only appear in Sword King City.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.880
So

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.210
the black-clad pipa player was Liu Yan.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:11.720
Why didn't you

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.920
tell me these things?

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.200
Because you didn't need to know.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.310
Liu Yan

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.820
is not your enemy.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.350
So for these 4 years,

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.160
you've searched everywhere,

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.160
trying to find him

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.270
to cure

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:27.530
your incurable old illness.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:28.390
Finding Liu Yan

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.670
to reclaim all the Rebirth Scroll power

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.900
is my only salvation.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.240
Both Liu Yan and you
mastered the Sound Killing Technique.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.100
Both know how to use the Rebirth Scroll.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.360
Then Head Fang's death

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.590
was Liu Yan's doing too, right?

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.680
I know you're reluctant to talk about

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.480
these things.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.000
But Yu Qifeng alone

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.150
is already difficult enough to deal with.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.510
Entering Sword King City this time,

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.600
with Liu Yan added to the mix,

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.200
makes it even more perilous.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.680
Tang Lici,

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:09.930
I consider you my brother.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.440
This time,

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.370
you can still choose not to answer.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:13.820
But I must ask.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:16.270
Fang Zhou

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:20.710
was killed by me.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.130
Impossible.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.920
I told you before.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.920
I am

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:35.830
not a good person.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.720
The perpetrator
of the Zhoudi Tower massacre

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.650
was me.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:43.010
Liu Yan saw him as his brother.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.510
That's why

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:46.810
he wants to kill me.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.310
There must be

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:49.770
more to this story, right?

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:51.980
You're like a brother to me.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.130
I know what kind of person you are.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:53.790
You're not someone

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.590
who would kill innocent people.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.540
You and Liu Yan were once friends.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.660
If you meet him in Sword King City,

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.070
what will you do?

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.920
Our old friendship

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.400
ended 4 years ago.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.920
Now,

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.800
my days are numbered.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.770
Even if it's for self-preservation,

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:27.780
it's time for me to collect my debt.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.840
We've talked enough

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.170
about the past tonight.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.110
Shen.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.130
A hero deserves good wine.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:11.060
Good wine.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.000
There's no wine left.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.400
Too little.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.040
There's plenty more.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.400
You don't look right.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.020
Even the most carefree person

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.280
would be upset when deceived

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.410
by their best friend

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:03.000
for so long.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.110
Is it because he killed Fang Zhou

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.370
and disappointed you?

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.030
I've known all along

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.480
that Foxy Tang

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.480
is no good person.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.550
Martial artists are always
prepared to die.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.480
Does it matter

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:17.000
whose hands they die by?

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.920
Even though I don't know

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.250
why he killed Fang Zhou,

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.480
it's enough to know

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:21.230
he is definitely

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.160
not someone who'd kill innocents.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:25.030
I'm an outlaw,

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.920
and he's a monster.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.770
You're no saint either.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:31.710
We're all birds of a feather.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.300
Fair point.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:35.790
What about Yu Qifeng?

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.000
You call yourself

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:38.030
an outlaw,

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.960
so why go against him?

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.160
Because he is

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.710
even worse.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.030
He hides
behind the facade of righteousness,

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.480
labeling anyone who opposes him

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.320
as evil.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.660
He confuses right and wrong,
so I'm going after him.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:52.790
Compared to Tang Lici and me,

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.400
you're not that bad.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:56.230
Shen,

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:57.920
you're even competitive

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.650
about being the worst villain.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.710
But why does he

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.620
always read the "Three Character Classic"?

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.400
You're not the first one

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.600
to ask that question.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:13.840
Actually, I don't know either.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.700
Master, whenever you hear this melody,

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.400
you think of Mr. Tang.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:53.920
Am I

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.240
playing well?

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:58.030
Xiaohong,

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.880
have you ever hated someone?

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.360
Of course, I have.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.180
How could anyone living in this world

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.660
never hate someone?

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.710
Master,

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.330
it's the same for you, right?

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.480
I thought with the departed long gone,

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.150
the hatred in my heart

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.610
would diminish somewhat.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:19.190
But now,

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:20.520
I hate even more deeply.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.720
I've heard

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.610
if grudges run deep and long,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.400
fate will somehow

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:27.630
bring us

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.320
to meet that person again.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:30.660
Then

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.300
what is this meeting for?

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:34.560
Meeting

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:36.570
is certainly for parting.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:38.070
Right.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.250
Meeting

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:43.820
is just for parting.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:55.050
Sword King City is just ahead.

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:58.230
Yu just loves to show off.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.090
This canal is so wide

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:02.990
that it could reach the heavens.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:06.510
Sword King City
has over 100,000 households.

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:07.880
The world-renowned tycoon

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.550
has a Wanqiao Chamber branch here as well.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:11.310
They've had business dealings
with the Yu family for years.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:13.360
Yu Qifeng controls the imperial transport
in the world

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.760
and intends to cooperate

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:16.460
with the Wanqiao Chamber.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:17.530
I know about the Wanqiao Chamber.

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:18.480
It belongs to the emperor's father-in-law

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.610
or brother-in-law.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:20.880
After Yique Yinyang's death,

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.920
just in only a few years,

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.510
Wanqiao Chamber

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.870
became the wealthiest in the region.

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:24.960
No wonder heroes from all over

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:25.880
gather here.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.680
But can business alone

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.690
win the respect of martial heroes?

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:30.650
Certainly not.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:32.440
When speaking of Sword King City,

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.970
one must mention Yu Xuanqing,
Sword Phoenixâ€”

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.840
known as

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.450
"Against all winds,
this sword alone glows;

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:40.820
among all weapons,
it stands unrivaled as the phoenix."

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.480
And she is

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.080
also one of the 7 masters,

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.840
who killed Yique Yinyang

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.070
in the battle of Tiandu Peak.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.130
Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:48.290
Sword Phoenix.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:49.280
Goodness.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:50.920
Killing Yique Yinyang

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.030
is truly remarkable.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:53.070
After the demise of Yique Yinyang

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.110
in the battle,

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.230
Yu Xuanqing was gravely injured
beyond recovery.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:57.400
She chose to go to the Tianyan Sword Wall

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.610
for liberation from her mortal body.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:39:59.510
Before she did so,

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:00.440
on the Tianyan Sword Wall,

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.900
she had left sword essence

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:03.670
for the destined one to claim.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.820
If Yu Qifeng hadn't

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.800
finally grasped

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.440
the true essence of

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.710
the Westwind Slashing Wildfire 3 years ago,

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.310
Sword King City could barely

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.490
sustain its former fame today.

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.780
The Yu Family's Sword Duel Festival starts
on the 7th day of the 9th lunar month

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.910
and lasts for 7 days.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:17.760
Sword Opening,

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.670
Sword Testing,

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:19.590
Sword Banquet,

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:21.950
and other various activities
are quite elaborate.

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:23.400
If I remember correctly,

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.510
today

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.210
happens to be the day of Sword Opening

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:27.270
and Sword Testing.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:49.830
[Sword King City]

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:16.160
This is the Yanhuang Sword.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.590
I've finally seen it.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:18.550
The grandeur of Sword King City

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:19.750
is truly impressive.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.190
The sect leaders
from 5 Schools and 18 Sects

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.920
are all here.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.190
Impressive.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:29.230
Unrivaled under the heavens.

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.880
What a magnificent sword.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.500
Yanhuang Sword.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.070
Yanhuang Sword is truly extraordinary.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:32.960
Yanhuang Sword.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.710
Sword King

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.590
is indeed the peak of swordsmanship

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.670
we all aspire to.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.500
Truly remarkable.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:40.110
Indeed.

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:42.150
Thanks to Sword King Yu's generosity,

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:43.320
youngsters like us

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.850
have the honor to behold it.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.190
Look.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.880
This sword is incredibly powerful.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.670
When will we

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.190
be able to become as powerful

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:52.190
as Sword Phoenix?

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:54.480
I don't know either.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:56.920
Why hasn't Sword King

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:57.760
arrived yet?

00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:59.790
It's getting rather boring.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.360
Master sent us to investigate

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.480
clues about
Sword King Yu's suspicious activities.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.000
We haven't found any clues.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.070
And now we have to watch these hypocrites

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:06.880
putting on a show of false courtesy.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.190
It's truly flawless.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.920
The upcoming arena match

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.960
must be worth watching.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.620
After that,

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:13.920
we can go to
the Sword Duel Festival's Phoenix Street

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.190
for a stroll.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:16.440
We could look for

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.570
any possible clues.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:21.360
Sword King has arrived.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.670
Greetings, Sword King.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:43.760
Zhong.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:48.310
You're all very kind.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.450
Today
is the Yu family's Sword Duel Festival.

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:52.760
On the first day of Sword Opening,

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.220
having all of you as guests

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:55.960
is my honor.

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:58.070
You're too modest, Sword King.

00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:59.000
I'm Ting He, and I'm very fortunate

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.920
to be invited

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.460
along with other heroes.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.760
Shi is right.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.860
Moreover, during this Sword Duel Festival,

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.630
Sword King
will share his family's swordsmanship,

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:09.500
the Martial Realm
of Westwind Slashing Wildfire,

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.440
to guide swordsmen
from all over the world.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.800
Sword King's selflessness

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.660
commands my deepest admiration.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:17.070
Bootlicker.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.190
As one

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.220
who bears the title of Sword King,

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:22.670
I must follow the example
of Ancestor Xuanqing

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:23.850
and open the doors of swordsmanship

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:25.480
to the younger generation
of the martial world.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.290
It is my duty.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.230
The Yu family's swordsmanship
holds secrets.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:31.890
If it can benefit the jianghu,

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:34.510
it will fulfill my greatest wish.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.340
Open the sword!

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:01.760
Release the sword!
