[Episode 15]

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.290
Happy New Year's Eve.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.100
Wake up. Time to eat.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.260
It's thin porridge and pickles every day.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.940
Can we have something else for once?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.170
What do you want then?

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.060
Fried tofu puffs.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.660
Tofu puffs?

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.410
You think you're an honored guest?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.410
You're a prisoner!

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.290
Tofu puffs?

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.300
What, the kind stuffed with meat, too?

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.900
This corn bun is hard as a rock.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.210
Sect Leader Yi

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.580
wants to negotiate with him,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.580
yet serves this kind of meal?

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.740
Sect Leader

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.900
gave no such order.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.490
But a prisoner here

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.900
always eats like this.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.860
Go.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.970
Prepare tofu puffs for Mr. Su,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.770
the kind stuffed with meat.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.180
Anything else, Mr. Su?

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.370
A bowl of hot rice will do.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.460
Go.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.620
Got it.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.370
How is it?

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.420
My lord,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.690
he's still trapped by the Drunken Dream Bone,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.250
no change at all.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.970
Then report back.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.320
Sect Leader

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.620
is cautious indeed.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.020
He sends checks every single day.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.140
Got it.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.770
I came to tell you something.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.650
Yi Bu is using your life

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.840
to force Su Changhe

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.450
to assassinate the Prince of Langya.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.570
He agreed.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.620
Has he made his move?

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.210
Seems this

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.690
doesn't surprise you.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.100
Changhe likes doing crazy things.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.740
And going after the Prince of Langya

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.250
is crazy enough.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.490
I believe

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.300
the moment he drew his blade,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.930
whatever his reason,

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.890
he'd feel the rush.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.860
But...

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.180
he must have failed.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.980
Why do you say that?

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.540
If he'd succeeded,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.180
shouldn't I be out by now?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.330
Fair point.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.370
The attempt failed.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.060
Su Changhe seems badly hurt.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.450
But...

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.420
using that as a pretext,

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.740
he asked Yi Bu

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.420
to let more of Blood River's elite killers

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.860

Uncle,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.570
do you know what a desperado is?

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.810
Someone

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.570
will do anything with no fear of death.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.660
A true desperado

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.660
likes to throw himself

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.890
into the deadliest spots,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.370
then claw his way out.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.980
Do you mean

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.220
the Patriarch of Blood River,

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.620
the one Li Xinyue

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.100
nearly killed?

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.780
The desperado

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.250
has already jumped into the game.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.690
Next comes...

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.450
cards on the table.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.740
Has that list

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.450
been sent to Uncle Qidao?

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.930
It's been delivered.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.330
At Uncle Qidao's pace,

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.550
those people

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.620
are already on their way.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.860
I saw the list.

Sir,

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.370
you're ruthless.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.690
How so?

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.890
I looked it over and over.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.930
On that list,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.220
the selection criteria

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.180
came down to one thing:

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.420
namely,

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.010
who's the deadliest

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.010
gets picked.

Isn't that Blood River's creed from day one?

Still,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.810
I think I've found an old friend.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.490
He's our sharpest blade.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.180
You mean...

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.370
Who came in?

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.930

That's me.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.370
Quit screaming like you've seen a ghost!

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.740
Or I'll kill you.

after you left Jiuxiao City,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.740
he sent people to look for you

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.010
and even sent you a letter.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.370
He says

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.490
he can cure my Heart-Piercing Poison.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:21.620
True.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.690
He was hit with the former Patriarch's Life-Death Contract,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.300
and broke it himself.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.490
How?

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.220
We'll know after we get him out.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.890
You cunning guy!

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.450
All right,

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.010
what do you need from me?

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.360
On the day we move,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.810
Su Muyu and I need to be elsewhere.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.930
And you

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.490
will hold off some troublesome types.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.450
Just stall them?

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.300
No killing?

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.930
If they won't back off,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:01.780
kill them all.

Forgive me! Forgive me!

You're the family head now.

Where's Muyu?

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.690
Why isn't he here?

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.180
Yeah.

Where's Muyu?

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.330
Strange.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.420
I just ran into three from the Su family.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.500
They asked me

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.730
why Su Muyu didn't come.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.210
Now I see my own folks,

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.330

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.500
why Su Muyu didn't come,

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.540
why didn't Su Muyu come.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.540
Then why didn't Muyu come?

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:08.810
Because he was caught.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:09.780
Right now,

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.330

Muyu's that strong.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.090
How could the Shadow Sect seize him?

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.930
This is Tianqi City,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.260
their turf.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.260
Then where's the Shadow Sect?

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.420
If I were the one captured,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.060
what would you do?

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.330
We'd take our time and plan.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.500
Then since it's Su Muyu who's captured,

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.610
what will you do?

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.260
No time to waste.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.930
I'm crying.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.730
That's not what we meant.

I was faking.

So when do we head out to rescue Muyu?

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.180
Don't rush.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.850
Su Muyu's in the Shadow Prison for now.

When the time is right,

you'll get your chance to fight.

For now,

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:20.970
just stay here

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.970
and wait for my signal.

What's the Patriarch's take?

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.500
What I'm saying

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.020
is exactly the Patriarch's will.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.700
He hasn't assigned

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.380
any task to you.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.420
Only this:

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.930
You all slipped into the city under cover,

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.140
so keep it that way.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.260
Don't let anyone

spot you.

Also,

when you go out,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.180
remember your veil.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.420
Otherwise...

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.500
you'll blow your cover too easily.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.330
Got it.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.090
How's the matter

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.090
I asked you to check?

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.800
The Xuanwu Guardian still hasn't returned.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.810
You likely

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.420
won't see him this trip.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:06.900
I'm off now.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.020
Cold as ever.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.180
Oh...

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.330
Had I known,

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.020
I wouldn't have come.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.780
Everyone,

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.450
today's topic

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.090
is the founding emperor, Xiao Yi.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.300
- Great! - Great!

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.380
He's eight chi tall,

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.020
bold and fearless.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.210
He trained from age five,

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.780
with a booklet bought for three coppers...

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.570
Uncle Qidao!

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.380
Oh, you're here.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.450
Have a seat.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.850
Uncle Qidao,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.300
did you move

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.330
the whole Xie family here?

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.610
It's the imperial capital.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.780
Men like us

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.570
only get one chance in life

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.570
to visit a place like this.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.420
So I brought them to broaden their horizons.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.780
That may be unwise.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.610
Relax.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.660
I borrowed someone else's identity.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.660
For now,

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.450
we're the Five Tigers Sect.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.870
We're here

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.500
to join the martial tournament.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.300
No one will question us.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.780
Blood River sent Su Zhe and Xie Qidao,

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.300
with eighteen elite killers.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.210
Only twenty men

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.060
to kill the Prince of Langya...

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.900
nowhere near enough.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.690
Su Changhe also sent news:

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.500
the time is set.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.330
In three days,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.730
the Prince of Langya will pray at Fengxiao Temple.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.120
With him

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.780
only Li Xinyue and Ji Ruofeng.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.210
It's the best chance to remove him.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.370
I've heard

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:07.690
he keeps that habit.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.810
It is a good opening.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.090
Then let's strike that day.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.570
Lead the Hawkeye unit

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.020
and hold the Shadow Prison.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.330
Until Blood River finishes,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.780
no one approaches...

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.420
including me.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.690
Including you?

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:30.730
Yes,

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.140
including me.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:35.380
Sir,

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.420
you suspect them?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.300
Just a precaution.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.180
Su Changhe's been

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.140
far too cooperative.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.090
It unsettles me.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.170
As you command!

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.020
- As you command! - As you command!

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.060
Sir,

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.450
this is a gamble.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.450
It is.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.500
So this time I'm betting

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.090
His Majesty

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.850
also wants the Prince of Langya dead!

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.060
They're brothers,

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.090
and the throne

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.450
was even ceded to him

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.540
by the Prince of Langya.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.090
Precisely because

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.730
that throne was given by him.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.660
Three days later,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.810
at Fengxiao Temple...

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.330
Day to day you'd never guess

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.850
the Prince of Langya is that devout.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.780
He isn't going there to worship.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.450
He's going to meet someone.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.930
How many came?

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.020
Uncle Qidao brought a dozen or so.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:58.210
Plus Uncle Zhe,

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.970
twenty elites on the surface

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.140
to ambush the Prince of Langya.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:02.930
In the shadows,

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.020
Xuewei,

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:04.900
Changli,

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.090
they're already in place.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.210
Count you and me,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.300
seven in all.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:09.540
The Shadow Sect

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:10.900
has no clue.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.260
Eight in all!

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.500
You're not of Blood River.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.900
This has nothing to do with you.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.970
But I'm Su Muyu's friend.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.180
He's with the Nan'an City Medicine Hall's,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:20.730
my partner.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.180
Fine.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:24.730
Then don't you die on me,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.210
or he'll blame me.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.090
I'm Su Zhe's daughter, you know.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.450
By the way,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.260
where's my father?

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.090
This time,

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.380
what's his assignment?

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.020
His task

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.660
is the most important.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.180
Someone from the Shadow Sect is here.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.180
Not Crow?

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.090
Crow has other business.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.690
I am the Shadow Sect's Left Shadow Guard,

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.730
Luo Tianxiang.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.930
I hear your Right Shadow Guard

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.140
is the Lone Sword Deity.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.450
He has a name close to mine,

00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.660
both "Qingyang."

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.260
Since you're the Left Shadow Guard

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.090
and your surname is Luo,

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:02.970
you must be

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.090
quite formidable as well.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.420
Senior Luo's swordwork is peerless.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:09.930
In the Shadow Sect, for decades,

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.450
only this one Sword Deity has emerged.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.970
I'm far beneath him.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.730
Then, Left Shadow Guard,

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:16.450
what brings you

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.380
here today?

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.210
Crow delivered the Patriarch's message.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.420
The Sect Leader has decided:

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:22.660
three days from now,

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.810
at Fengxiao Temple,

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.540
we ambush the Prince of Langya.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.540
Go tell your Sect Leader Yi Bu:

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.850
within three days,

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.420
we need more intel.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:35.780
Killing the Prince of Langya

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:36.970
isn't something decided

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:37.970
with a single sentence.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.210
Of course.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.380
In this fight,

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.850
none of us has a way back.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.020
The Sect Leader will send Tianqi City's "shadow"

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.850
to move with you.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.260
At the critical moment,

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.140
he'll act himself.

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:06.330
Sir.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.780
Elders,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.610
you're here.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:12.890
Looks like you've

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.740
run into trouble.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.850
You summoned all three of us at once.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.370
However...

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.300
I understand.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.740
You three have retired from the jianghu

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.740
and don't wish to meddle in Tianqi's affairs.

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.780
But,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.220
this matter is grave.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.410
We may have to mobilize

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.300
over half the Shadow Sect's forces,

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.300
so I ask the three of you

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.170
to help guard one place.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.810
All three of us,

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.940
to guard a single place?

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.740
You mean

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.610
the Wanjuan Tower?

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.850
Yes.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.460
Master?

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.500
Master.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:18.980
Master.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.330
Don't nod off.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.220
Master.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.090
Your Highness?

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.060
Apologies.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.330
The road was long.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.740
I got a bit tired

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.130
and dozed off.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.170
Master Forget-Joy

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.780
and Master Forget-Worry

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.330
are quite the pair.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.060
My senior

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.890
is named "Forget-Worry,"

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.540
yet these days

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.570
he worries nonstop.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.300
I'm "Forget-Joy,"

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.740
and live free and easy.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.780
Truly fate toys with us.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.650
Just now in meditation,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.650
I dreamed

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.540
the Buddha spoke with me

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.460
on the path of joy and sorrow.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.090
Master,

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.300
we've known each other for years.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.500
Why put on the sage act

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.060
in front of me?

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.150
You actually dreamed

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.940
of Tianxiang Restaurant's

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.740
All-Vegetable Banquet,

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:28.980
from dawn

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.710
all the way to sunset.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.260
How did you know?

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.740
You drool

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:36.260
was dripping.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.500
Amitabha.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.460
My fault.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.260
Master,

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.410
how are Master Forget-Worry

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:48.890
and the boy lately?

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.890
Are they doing well?

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.370
That child,

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.130
like his father Ye Dingzhi,

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.260
is a martial genius.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.700
Thank you.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.460
I'd rather

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.220
he be ordinary.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.060
The stronger he is,

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:10.810
the greater the risk.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.020
Mr. Su,

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.130
I thought the last time we met

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.650
would be

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.020
our final meeting.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.370
So did I.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.020
Then,

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.330
what changed your mind?

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.060
That cursed thing called fate.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.330
The Demon-Taming Staff.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.810
Sharp eye, Master.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.940
It is the Demon-Taming Staff.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.090
I'm the demon in your heart, Su Zhe.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:53.330
I'm here to help Your Highness

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.130
cast it out.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.610
Who are those bandits

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.610
to dare assassinate the Prince of Langya?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.850
If you ask me,

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.780
[Ji Ruofeng, Guardian White Tiger]
they're likely acquaintances.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:21.700
Blood River,

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.060
show yourselves!

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.500
Kill!

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.260
What's this?

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.410
So few men?

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.890
Why didn't your squad

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:49.980
bring more along?

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.510
The Patriarch was badly wounded

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.930
in the last attempt

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.020
on the Prince of Langya.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.700
We must keep enough hands

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.410
to guard him!

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:03.300
You knew

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:04.600
I'd come here

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.850
with few guards,

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.350
so you thought

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.410
it was the perfect time to kill me.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.940
We never believed we could kill you.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.090
The price is too high.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.940
Blood River can't afford it.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.500
Then why

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.700
are we meeting here?

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.700
Didn't I just say?

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.780
Blame it on cursed fate.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.980
Amitabha...

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.570
My Prajna Bell

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.410
isn't as good as my senior's.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:41.740
Your Highness...

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.700
my inner force

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.570
is spent.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:48.300
If blood is shed at Fengxiao Temple,

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:51.370
the blame is mine.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.720
Let me witness

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.650
the fabled Realm-Rending Sword Art.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.300
Heaven-Demon Sixteen Dances!

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.300
Few have ever seen

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.540
the true Demon dance.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.700
Those who did

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.060
are already dead.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.940
You might survive,

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:32.370
but this Demon

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.410
will walk with you forever!

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.740
Hold on.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.650
I'm calling for reinforcements.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.540
Got it!

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.460
"Stage a fine play with me.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.090
Draw the Shadow Sect away,

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.220
and level the Wanjuan Tower.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:19.980
By Muyu"

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.540
All right.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.650
I'm heading to Tianqi City now

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.810
to see how "fine" this play really is.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:40.170
Come in.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.330
Uncle Zhe has struck.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.500
At Fengxiao Temple,

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:48.650
the killing's begun.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:49.890
Uncle Zhe said

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.940
it'll shake the heavens and earth.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:52.940
He guarantees it.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.850
Send the heaven-rank killing order.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.850
Time the real blade

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.740
showed itself.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.740
I have waited

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.060
for this day

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.090
a long time.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:06.740
Fight, then go home.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.370
Tianqi City bores you?

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.740
I'd bet even Su Muyu,

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.260
locked in the Shadow Prison,

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.410
finds it interesting.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:16.330
Dull, actually.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.740
Always feels like

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.460
a string is pulling me.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.170
And today,

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.610
we'll cut that string.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.060
A fresh-carved peachwood sword?

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.220
It's blessed at Mount Wangcheng.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.780
You like playing the diviner that much?

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.330
I even dreamed of soaring off

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.460
as an immortal.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:53.700
Sir.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.460
Su Zhe and Xie Qidao

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:56.500
led killers to ambush Xiao Ruofeng

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.130
at Fengxiao Temple.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.170
But it seems

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.500
they can't best the prince's men.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.330
We received

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.130
our men's distress signal.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.740
Send more to Fengxiao Temple.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.980
Dispatch the Shadow Guards

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:09.810
from the Wanjuan Tower too.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.700
No more standing by.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:12.890
Move in!

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:14.300
What... what if we're exposed?

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.060
If he dies,

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.850
the one commanding Tianqi's defenses

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.170
won't be him anymore.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.570
What's to fear?

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.410
Got it.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:37.740
Young miracle physician.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.020
Who knew

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.500
we'd meet again?

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.220
I'm glad to see you again,

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.410
Beauty Mu.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.370
Here.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.940
Will this little thing

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.700
find Su Muyu shortly?

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.570
That depends on the tacit bond between Muyu and me.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:05.940
After all,

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.300
we've cheated death together so many times.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.170
If there's no bond,

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:12.410
then everything

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:13.540
falls apart.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:17.980
If our bond

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:18.810
is proven,

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.410
will you start overthinking it?

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.410
Beauty Mu,

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.810
why tease me

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.650
like the Patriarch?

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:26.410
We're not

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.700
what you think.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.260
I understand.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:30.540
Just friends.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.740
Good friends.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.220
Sir!

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.020
Sir.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.570
Any trouble here?

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.300
No trouble.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.540
Rest easy, Sir.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.090
Good.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:57.610
You did well.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.570
Thank you for the praise.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:01.890
All right.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.170
Sir.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.330
What are you doing?

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.540
What,

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.940
can't I enter either?

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.700
I wouldn't...

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.060
dare stop you!

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:24.460
How dare you!

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.060
Drop the act.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.650
How did you know?

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.540
The Sect Leader and I made an agreement:

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.090
even he

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.700
can't enter the Shadow Prison.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.610
If he truly had to

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.610
he'd first remind me

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.260
of that agreement

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.460
before stepping in.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:47.850
But you came

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.500
as if no such agreement

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:50.540
existed.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.890
So you must be an impostor!

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:56.610
Didn't expect

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.540
Yi Bu

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.130
to be clever sometimes.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:00.590
The Shadow Prison's guard

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:01.740
is now the Hawkeye unit.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.370
Even we Three Officials

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:05.920
don't have the rank

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.260
to bypass them.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.810
Then I'll change my face.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.410
Yi Bu would never imagine

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.540
someone bold enough

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:14.850
to use his identity

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.060
to slip inside.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:32.780
Traitor!

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.310
I don't know what Yi Bu's thinking.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.220
Blood River's strength

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.810
already dwarfs the Shadow Sect's,

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.500
yet he clings to stale rules

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:42.810
to keep Blood River in check.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.740
I'm not like my two foolish partners.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.850
You betrayed us?

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.500
I told you

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.460
I admire Su Changhe.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.940
After that Yellow Springs Pawnshop affair,

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.780
I started contacting them.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.560
He's smarter than you all.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.570
He chooses

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.610
the right side.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.460
You can't win.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.940
Ever consider this:

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.540
even if Su Muyu's caught,

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.000
it may just be

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.940
a trap to bottle you.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.660
And the one in the jar

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.740
won't be Su Muyu,

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:37.890
but...

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.240
the Shadow Sect.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.410
What do you mean?

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.960
Even if we seize Su Muyu,

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.230
how many men to guard him?

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.260
If he breaks out,

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.570
how many more

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.460
to stop him?

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.130
By then,

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.330
the Shadow Sect is meat on the block.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.500
Enough talk.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:05.890
Mu Ying.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:10.940
Did you get his face?

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.020
Not much

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.410
worth remembering.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.540
About nine-tenths.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.780
Good.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.410
Then the real Heaven Official

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:37.370
needn't exist.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.940
I...

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.940
only choose the strong side.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.780
What's this array?

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.570
The Dipper Array.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.170
Its killing power is average.

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:57.890
But at trapping,

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.740
it's among the best under heaven.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.220
If you've got the skill,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.170
break it!

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.650
Looks like they're exposed.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:42.780
Pretty nasty.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.370
My one drop of antidote

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.410
won't clear all the Drunken Dream Bone.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.330
Ms. Yumo,

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.940
got any more tracking spiders?

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.810
This one's unique to Muyu.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.370
It takes a long time

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.980
to raise one like it.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.500
Still,

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:16.740
It's Muyu.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.460
Even with a single drop,

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:19.740
he'll find a way

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.090
to crack it.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:23.940
True.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.090
He is Su Muyu.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.460
As if a sword fell from the sky...

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.270
[As if a sword fell from the sky]

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:32.740
Yue'an,

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:33.810
live on.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.610
When you grow into a Sword Deity,

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.170
revive our No-Sword City.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:39.500
[The mist breaks, gone for good]

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.300
How strong can one sword become?

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.020
First it strikes down ten,

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:47.370
then a hundred,

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:48.980
then a thousand,

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.410
even ten thousand!

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.270
[As if a sword fell from the sky]

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.880
[The mist breaks, gone for good]

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.020
I gaze at the world's endless grief,

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.060
Look again...

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.900
the moon hangs high.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.940
[As if a sword fell from the sky]

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.540

Father,

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.170
lend me your righteous sword energy tonight.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:35.940
