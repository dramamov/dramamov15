It seems we're going to die here.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.290
Look.

The sky is getting dark,

yet we still haven't managed to break through the gate.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.900

Su Muyu?

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.610
So, you neutralized the Drunken Dream Bone

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.980

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.730
You truly bring unexpected surprises.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.570
The battle has already begun.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.010
Our swords are already unsheathed.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.610
There's no need to care too much.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.890
You have a point.

Thank you.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.170
It's my honor

to witness such changes.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.260
Me too.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.130
The direction he's heading in,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.940
is it the Wanjuan Tower.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.780
So, you guys lay dormant all this time

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.820

[Forbidden Ground, No Entry]

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.170
According to my plan,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.660
I suppose most of the Shadow Sect's forces

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.010
have been transferred elsewhere,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.170
including Wanjuan Tower.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.340
But it seems the Shadow Sect's foundations

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.610
run deeper than we imagined.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.220
You're pretty good.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.540
It seems Master Su

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.930
is our current goal

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.160
to annihilate the Shadow Sect?

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.290
What has the Shadow Sect got to do with us?

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.660
That's the duty of Tianqi City.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.460
Our current goal

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.140

What's so special about it?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.250
The Wanjuan Tower

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.580
houses the information

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.730
of all members in Blood River.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.700
Rumor has it that every detail was recorded

Doesn't that mean...

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.100

Right now, Su Muyu

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.810

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.220

What is their goal?

I'm afraid

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.220
the attack on Fengxiao Temple is just a feint.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.900
Their encirclement of Shadow Sect

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.220
seems to be a long-coming plot of theirs.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.220
They pretended to attack Xiao Ruofeng

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.340
while borrowing a large number of our forces,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.100
causing the security here to be lax.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.220
What an elaborate plot.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.850
It's a shame that they forgot something.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.170
How could I rule over the Shadow Sect

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.100
all these years if I didn't have

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.980
a trick or two up my sleeves?

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.370
Within Wanjuan Tower,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.610
I've left them

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.850
with a huge gift!

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.900
Why do they care about Wanjuan Tower so much?

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.170
What they truly fear

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.250
isn't the power of Shadow Sect.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.780
It's the fact that the Shadow Sect

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.020
keeps all of Blood River's secrets.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.540
As long as they destroy

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.340
all of the hidden documents

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.780
in Wanjuan Tower,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.810
they can

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.780
hide their tracks entirely.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.250
By then, they can establish

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.100
a new Blood River.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.610
This time,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.900
I've truly lost the bet.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.490

behind No-Sword City's annihilation.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.540
You bet on the fact

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.810
that they would yield to the coercion

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.100
due to their desire for freedom.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.930
But you don't understand them at all.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.410
They were able to get this far

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.220
because they didn't fear any coercion.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.930
Each step they took was getting them closer to freedom.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.930
I already gave you a reminder,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.290

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.250
the eunuchs guarding the Imperial Mausoleum

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.250
are not to leave the premises.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.370
And now, you're taking one more step away.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:06.820
I haven't included

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.730
the number of steps you've taken previously as well.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.490
Chancellor,

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:11.730
you see,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.100
certain things are meaningless if you make them too obvious.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.650
Indeed.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.700
Certain things are meaningless

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.460
if we make them too obvious.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.340
Chancellor, it seems

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.180
you're bent on stopping me today.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.580
Not necessarily.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.460
I just want to play a round of weiqi with you.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.650
If we do engage each other in battle,

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.180
I suppose the entire Tianqi City

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.650
will tremble.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.940
Ever since the great battle atop the Imperial City

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.530
between Baili Dongjun and Ye Dingzhi,

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.460
Tianqi City

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.610
has never welcomed such a spectacle again.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:06.370
Let me put it this way.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.700
Some of the spectacles happened deep at night.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.220
They ended before dawn.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.340
Many people couldn't witness them.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.250
If, back then,

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:39.730
Mr. Li didn't inflict

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.100
a blow to my head,

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.580
I suppose

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.250
I would've engaged you in combat

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.530
today.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.420
I wonder

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.940
if Mr. Li was a prophet

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.010
or he just wanted to bully me.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.340
Stop overthinking it.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.180
He merely wanted to bully you.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.130
It's better for you

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:03.890
to play weiqi with me.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.130
You stopped my arrow.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.490
Good job.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.490
I can tell.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.970
It's either that you were injured

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.010
or you just recovered from a serious illness.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.730
Your zhenqi is very unstable.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.370
But I'm sure you can't stop

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.220
my next technique, Seven Stars.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.730
Seven Stars?

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.850
This is a bow technique passed down by my ancestors.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.340
This technique had killed five warlords born of chaos.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.610
You should feel honored that I'm using it

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.180
on an assassin like you.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.220
The power of this arrow

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.490
is actually almost twice

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:20.700
the last arrow.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.770
For Seven Stars,

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.180
each arrow is stronger than the last.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:26.890
If you try to block another arrow,

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.340
your sword will surely break.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.650
What is...

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.460
Is that Sword of Taiji?

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.340
An assassin like you actually knows how to use

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.490
the slowest sword art in the world, huh?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.010
However, the next arrow

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.130
won't be as simple.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.300
Is that so?

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:22.580
But it's also obvious that your technique

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.300
is consuming a lot of your stamina.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:26.340
Please fire

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.250
your next arrow.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.560
I'll leave this place to you guys.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.650
I'll go and check on the head of the Su family.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:46.340
All right!

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.220
So, this is the so-called Shadow Sect, huh?

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.180
You guys think that you can control Blood River when you're this weak?

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.940
Fools.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.980
This is an artifact of Mu family,

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.290
the Celestial Ninefold Zither.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:37.660
I couldn't find it

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.900
when I searched our sect.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:40.940
It turns out

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.700
that he was bringing it with him everywhere he went.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.420
So, you're still alive.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.180
You traitor.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.050
As a member of the Mu family,

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.010
how dare you serve the Su family?

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:00.730
You idiot.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.380
Blood River's rule has already shifted,

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.010
yet you're still talking about the Three Families?

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.570
The tide has already cast you away.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.940
Time to die.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.730
Together with the old Blood River.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.490
I have one last arrow.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.810
And you

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.420
will die for sure!

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:51.620
Grandfather.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:52.660
Uncles.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:59.090
You're finally here.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.180
Are you reprimanding me for being late?

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.900
So, you two are

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.630
the current leaders of Blood River, huh?

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.380
You two do look very young.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.730
I'm Su Changhe, the Patriarch of Blood River.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.460
Greetings, elders.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.980
The person next to me is Su Muyu.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.900
He's the current head of the Su family.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.660
Elders, may I know your names?

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.590
[Xie Biyou, Shadow Sect]

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.860
Xie Biyou.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.240
[Mu Fusheng, Shadow Sect]

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.330
Mu Fusheng.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.460
[Su Ziyan, Shadow Sect]
Su Ziyan.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.570
So, your surnames are Xie,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:33.330
Mu,

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.180
and Su?

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.220
Those are the surnames of Blood River's Three Families.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.010
Who are you guys?

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.980
They're quite surprised upon hearing

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.010
our surnames.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.330
Indeed.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.700
We and the Three Families of Blood River

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.010
come from the same branch.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:53.530
Back then,

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.220
some of our ancestors

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.700
joined the martial world

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.420
while some of them remained here.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.290
The three of us

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.860
are the descendants of those

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.730
who remained in Tianqi City.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.860
That only includes your ancestors.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.530
It doesn't include us.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.860
Chang He and I were born Nameless.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.860
We bear no lineage of the Three Families.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.700
So, the Three Families of Blood River

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.130
have already been

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.650
taken over by outsiders like you all.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.420
No wonder you would invade our premises

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.420
and go against the Shadow Sect!

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.700
When the old fades, the new ascends.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.810
That's the rule of the world.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.770
Young men,

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.420
did you two come here

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:45.460
to infiltrate Wanjuan Tower?

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.770
Indeed.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.090
However, there are

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.180
no treasures or martial arts manuals

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.010
within Wanjuan Tower.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.620
It only harbors the secrets

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.330
of the world.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.050
What exactly

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.180
is your goal here?

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.090
Since it harbors the secrets of the world,

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.570
naturally, it also harbors the secrets of Blood River.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.420
Are you guys

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.810
trying to destroy Wanjuan Tower?

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.220
So what if we are?

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.900
Not only are we going to destroy Wanjuan Tower,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.940
but we're also going

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.700
to sever the ties

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.220
between Blood River and Shadow Sect.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:24.250
It seems

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:25.900
the wish of our pioneers

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.010
during the founding of our nation,

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.010
which was to protect the nation with its shadow,

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.900
has fallen apart.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.420
It fell apart long ago.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.660
Blood River and Shadow Sect stopped being

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.980
the shadow that protected the world long ago.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.330
Now, we're the pawns

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.730
of those who fight for power

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.090
in broad daylight.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.490
Do you think Nameless individuals like you two

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.980
can sever the ties of the two organizations?

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.700
I alone am enough.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.620
Eighteen-Sword Array?

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.620
Let me exchange some blows with you, then.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.380
My pleasure.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:36.660
Uncle Zhe,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.050
all of Shadow Sect's members have retreated.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.860
I suppose they found out

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.040
that we had destroyed their den.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.010
Since that's the case,

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.580
there's no point in keeping up the act.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.140
Your Highness, your Realm-Rending Sword Art

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.430
is amazing indeed.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.930
Mr. Su Zhe, your Heaven-Demon Sixteen Dances

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.700
is ferocious as well.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.620
It's been so many years

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.420
since I last enjoyed a fight.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.380
If so, we shall put a stop to our act.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.940
But the final result of this conflict

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.770
will still depend on the two brothers

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.730
in Tianqi City.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:15.050
Your Highness,

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.490
do you want a puff?

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.100
Mr. Su, you're too courteous.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:21.770
If so,

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:24.620
why don't you have some preserved plums?

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.420
There's nothing left.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.000
Your blow had crushed all of them.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.980
What a shame.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.270
Mr. Su, you're interesting indeed.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:42.890
Preserved plums and a pipe,

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.860
lying on the ground with all fours, good night.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:47.420
Abbot, you're wrong.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.700
It should be "running with all fours, full of might."

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.220
Amitabha.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:53.860
Even if you were to stop

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.530
the sharpest Puppet Razor Strings,

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.940
the only bladeless weapon

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.250
in the world,

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.530
you'll be ripped to shreds

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.810
the moment you block it.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.090
You might still stand a chance to survive

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.010
if you use Hell Palm now.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.570
The Hell Palm is unnecessary

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.530
to deal with an eccentric person like you

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.530
who doesn't even dare to face me head-on.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.490
Back then, in our generation,

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.140
the Mu family

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.050
had the highest chance to rise to the top

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.010
because of you and me.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.140
It's all your fault.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.810
You didn't heed Master's words

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.660
and merely did what you liked.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:41.940
It caused the Mu family

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.980
to be the weakest family

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.810
among the Three Families.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.420
I...

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.770
I only live for my own sake!

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.490
If other people attack me,

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.180
I'll return the favor.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.330
If other people want to kill me,

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:00.940
I'll kill them

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.220
before they can kill me!

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.250
If they want to make me bow

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.570
and succumb,

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.620
I will stand strong with my own strength!

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.700
Dance of 1,000 Butterflies!

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.180
This is when the real game begins.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:54.940
He actually crushed the Celestial Ninefold Zither

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:56.530
without using Hell Palm.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:13.380
I've lost.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:16.810
That's right.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:19.490
You've lost.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.290
Now,

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:28.770
I finally understood

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.380
what Master meant back then.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.940
Zizhe,

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.220
why do you live?

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.460
I live for the glory of the Mu family.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.180
I, Mu Zizhe, wish to make the Mu family prosper.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:52.250
I will make our family the leader among the Three Families.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:54.810
Excellent.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.770
Ciling,

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:02.620
what about you?

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:08.220
You're distracted again.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:13.770
Ciling,

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.810
why do you live, then?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.660
Of course I live for my own sake.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.360
The Mu family

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.490
is made up of members of the Mu family.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.490
If every member of the Mu family

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:25.530
can truly live for

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:26.460
their own sake

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.220
and become strong,

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.320
the Mu family will prosper naturally.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:31.290
By then,

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.090
the Mu family could rule over the Three Families naturally.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.900
If I can become the strongest member of Blood River,

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.490
naturally, the Mu family

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.770
will become the strongest clan in Blood River.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:24.540
♪The wind still sighs, scattering fate's remains♪

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:31.420
♪The slanting rain moistens a youthful chain♪

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.220
♪In a fleeting glance, I gather frost and regret♪

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.220
♪Upon the board, I wager my soul to chase the moon again...♪

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.940
What a fool.

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.770
He's helpless.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.090
Utterly helpless.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:01.020
♪The stubborn flame devours the calloused cocoon...♪

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.660
The question that Master asked us back then

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.290
had no meaning to it at all!

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:09.860
If that's the case,

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.140
several decades had passed since then.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.380
How would you know immediately

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.380
which question Mu Zizhe was referring to

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:18.180
right before

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:18.860
his death?

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.700
♪A fleeting breeze snuffs out the name I bore...♪

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.490
It's because every word uttered

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.530
by that old fool

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.700
was meaningless.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.770
Blood River is meaningless.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.010
The Mu family is meaningless.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.860
Killing is meaningless.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.940
Only the existence of I, Mu Ciling,

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.660
have my own meaning!

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:55.810
I couldn't tell at all.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.230
To think that you were a philosopher.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.380
You...

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.220
You idiot.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.380
Arrest them!

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:12.520
They came here much quicker than we thought.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.930
Let's help Yu

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:14.980
to stall them.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:15.420
Let's go.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:18.090
Why don't we head inside?

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:19.860
We should wait for Changhe's signal.

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.900
He said

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.660
he would only summon us

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.980
when it's absolutely necessary.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.010
They must be idiots.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.050
Why must they head inside and force a fight?

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.180
With your 1,000-Spider Array

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.940
and the mystical poison I invented,

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:33.530
the Shadow Sect

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:34.700
can be dealt with easily.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:37.940
Miss Bai, are you anxious?

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.030
Aren't you anxious at all?

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.420
Don't worry.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.490
The two brothers have never lost a fight

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.810
that they fought together.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.220
Inside your sword lies an aura.

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:10.770
I saw it before.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.770
It's Spring Rain Sword Aura.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:14.010
Kid,

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.780
who exactly are you?

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.770
I'm Su Muyu of Blood River.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.730
I'm also a vengeful spirit

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:21.330
of No-Sword City.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.180
The lord of No-Sword City,

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:25.050
Zhuo Yuluo,

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.380
who is he to you?

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.420
He's my father.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.980
Now that I'm looking at you,

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.700
you do resemble him a lot.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:37.770
So, the lord of No-Sword City

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.090
actually has a descendant, huh?

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.180
And, his descendant actually became

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.460
a Nameless of Blood River.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.290
This is interesting indeed.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.220
Now, I understand

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.330
why you must visit

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.810
the Wanjuan Tower behind me.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.250
It's because it contains

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.180
the secret of your background.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:57.660
It also contains the secret

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.660
behind No-Sword City's annihilation.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:00.700
That's right.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.570
Therefore, no one

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:03.530
can stop me.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.050
If that's the case,

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.090
we have no choice but to join hands.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:22.860
You guys are truly shameless.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:24.900
You three are trying to gang up on him.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.740
If so, let me join the fight.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.980
Changhe.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.460
You should leave for now.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:30.980
I know you're already exhausted.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.460
You don't need to fight

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.420
as long as I'm still standing.

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:37.340
Although we have the same surnames,

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.130
they led a pampered life

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.980
in Tianqi City.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.050
Generations had passed.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:43.490
They're no longer the shadow

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:44.460
within the darkness.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.210
Now, they're nobles

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.050
that live on the surface.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.820
They've long forgotten

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.860
how to take one's life.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.820
I didn't expect

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.210
to witness the true Eighteen-Sword Array again

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.740
in this lifetime.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.300
Back then, there were only 17 swords.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.610
I never witnessed the 18th sword.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.420
When the 18th sword is used,

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.260
winning or losing no longer matters.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.050
Only one's life is at stake.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.650
If so, let's see who the final victor is!

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.380
You would've died

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:04.460
had we not joined hands.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.530
You guys may leave.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:11.900
I no longer wish to be an assassin.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.780
The members of Blood River

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:14.980
no longer wish to do so either.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.420
That's right.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:18.780
But I think

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:20.690
you shouldn't leave anyone alive

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:23.460
now that you've shown them the 18th sword.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.780
Although Changhe and I are Nameless,

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.900
we have companions

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.860
just like you all.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.530
They have the surnames Su,

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:35.260
Xie, and Mu,

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:37.460
which are the same as yours.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.530
Emotions never mattered in Blood River.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:44.800
However, I hope that they will be able to lead a life

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.610
where they can walk in the sunlight.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.980
We were one from the start.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.940
The Shadow Sect ruled over Blood River and the Three Families.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.180
At the same time, they support our three families

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.360
in Tianqi City.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.300
I don't dare to promise anything else.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.380
But there's one thing I can promise.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.820
From now on,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:13.940
the Shadow Sect shall cease to exist.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.570
Once you leave this place,

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.410
no one is going to cause trouble for you all.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:24.870
There are certain things that have to be changed.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.940
We will reach the Other Shore eventually.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.780
There should not

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.490
be endless night,

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.610
but light.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:40.340
Excellent!

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.740
You've thoroughly impressed me.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:46.090
Fusheng.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:47.980
That's enough.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:50.690
Yi Bu

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.940
wasn't a leader worth our service.

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.090
The three of us knew that

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:56.610
long ago.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.740
Moreover, now,

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.890
the Four Guardians of Tianqi,

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.050
who serve the Prince of Langya,

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.530
reign supreme in Tianqi City.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:05.900
The Shadow Sect

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.940
has fallen from grace long ago.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.380
Instead of perishing together with him,

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.490
we should

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.490
seek another way out.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.900
If so, Mr. Su,

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.570
let us part ways here.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.530
I hope you can realize your wish

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.620
and bring forth a new Blood River.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.940
The current Blood River is already a brand new organization.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.460
It's just that its image in people's hearts

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:36.780
hasn't changed yet.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.980
[Wanjuan Tower]

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.380
I suppose Yu has succeeded.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:54.260
Miss Bai.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.260
I don't think anything else will happen here.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:59.450
You should head to the inn

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.140
and meet up with the rest.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:01.260
What about you?

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.690
Now that things have settled down,

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.170
it's time for me to deal with my personal affairs.

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.860
I won't be heading back.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.170
All right.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.740
Beauty Mu,

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.690
please look after yourself.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:12.380
Farewell.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:25.940
Why did you do that?

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:27.650
You wouldn't need to end up like this

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.690
had we fought together just now.

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:35.610
If we fought together just now,

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.260
both parties would've fought until the end.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.530
It's been so long

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:40.420
since you used the 18th sword.

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:41.690
Logically speaking,

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.240
once you cast the complete Eighteen-Sword Array,

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.420
no one would've survived.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:46.870
But you actually spared those old fools.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.340
If I must say, you should've killed them.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.260
We have to start from scratch anyway.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:53.490
There are certain things we have to start from scratch,

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.420
but not everything.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.780
For example, we have to

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:02.260
reduce Wanjuan Tower to ashes.

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.010
Changhe,

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.090
the opponent we reserved for you is arriving.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.170
If it's against him,

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:11.860
I can cast aside life and death, am I right?

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:13.420
Suit yourself.

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:15.300
All right.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.420
Wait.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.380
Su Muyu,

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.940
why do I feel like

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.980
you're the true Patriarch

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:24.380
while I'm just an errand boy?

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:32.740
I suppose I brought this upon myself.
