I hear the competition rate
for major corporations

has jumped to 10 to 1
after the IMF crisis.

You seem to be overdoing this, Mr. Kim.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.278
No, sir. This is the company
I've wanted to join the most.

00:02:33.362 --> 00:02:35.489
You must have applied
to other companies too, though.

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:38.200
No, sir. All throughout
my university life,

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:41.745
my goal was to join ACT, the leader
of Korea's telecommunication industry.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:45.123
That is why I only applied to ACT.

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:50.545
I know quite a few people in HR
at other companies.

00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:54.675
I can find out if you're lying
with one phone call.

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:55.884
No, sir.

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.553
I'm not lying.

[Nak-su] Of course, the birth of my child
would be a joyous occasion.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.148
But without the company,
neither my child nor I could exist,

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:13.443
so I would ask my wife
for her understanding

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:16.238
and go meet my client
instead of going to the hospital.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.198

Mr. Heo?

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:36.675
He seems very passionate and confident.

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.471
He doesn't seem confident.

The reporters seem to have caught on.

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:29.079
Reporters?

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.498
"Manager in his fifties relocated
to Ulleungdo overnight."

"Office worker ordered
to climb down manholes."

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:38.755
If they write articles like that,
it'll make a lot of people uncomfortable.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.132
And you'll be the one who ends up losing.

Yes. Right now.

Who is this?

[Jeong-hwan] I'm Lee Jeong-hwan.
We met a while back.

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:08.942
I got your number from Han-na.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.152
You don't act like you're
from Gangnam or Seocho.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:14.197
I was quite rude to you.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:15.949
I'm really sorry.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.202
No, it's fine. I--

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:20.453
[Han-na] Let me talk to him.

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.163
Hey, Su-gyeom.

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:23.540
-Oh, hey.

No, I'm not.

00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:30.421
[Han-na] Then where are you?

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:32.465
Well, I'm with a friend…

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:36.427
at an exhibit.

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.096
[Han-na] What exhibit?

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.180
Well…

[Han-na] Are you busy?

Can you come by my workplace
for a moment?

It's not one of those gold herbal pills.

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:16.259
I made a hole-in-one two weeks ago.

I wasn't even in good condition that day.

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:23.349

I don't even remember.

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:27.103
I just hit the ball,

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:30.982
and it just went right
in the hole somehow.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.652
You know how bad I am. It was crazy.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:35.987
A hole-in-one? It's insane.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.157
I spent so much money that day.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.700
That cost 1.5 million won.

Let's just hang in there, all right?

We're at the ninth hole of our lives.

Who knows if we'll end up
with a bogey or a hole-in-one?

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.308
they'd do well by you,
so if you just wait--

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:06.559
What will they do about me?

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:12.315
-Well, they're discussing it now--

just because I tried to commit suicide.
So what are they saying?

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:19.697
Tae-hwan, I'm not sure, either.

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:21.115
You should calm down first--

the hospital bills are going to be.

Damn it.

They haven't told me anything
for the past two weeks.

[pensive music playing]

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:43.137
They should at least tell me
what they'll do

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:44.681
so I can make plans.

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:48.559
Nothing's changed
since I lit up those charcoal briquettes.

So what?

Did you bring this to me
thinking it would comfort me?

Seriously?

Gosh, it got a dent.

I have no special skills, no savings,

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.960
and all I have is my apartment deposit.

00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:16.879
I can't even imagine
how I'll survive my remaining years.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.924
Living a long life
would be a disaster for me.

I can tell what you're thinking
just from your expression.

You're thinking,
"Damn. I'm so glad I'm not this loser."

"What if this idiot makes me lose
my chance at becoming an executive?"

Don't worry about him.

I'm sure the company
will take good care of him.

He's worked at ACT for 25 years.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:47.929
Then why did they do that to him?

there's Kim Nak-su from Team 1,

Do Jin-woo and Shin Jun-seop from Team 2,

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:02.855
and then Oh Jung-sik and Cho Jae-jung
from the SMB team.

-He--
-[Jae-hyeok] Think of it this way.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.299
He'll be saving his colleague
and going there in his place.

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:32.134
How noble is that?

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.145
Honestly, he was incredible as a salesman,

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:46.232
but after becoming a manager,
he hasn't been doing well.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:50.278
Don't you agree?

00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:53.573
Disagree?

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:55.366
He's working with me on something.

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:56.867
I know.

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:59.745
I heard he got a hole-in-one last week.

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:03.207
When do you think
you'll be done with that?

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.169
Come on. Can't somebody else do it?

00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:12.341
[sighs] Gosh.

00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:15.011
I'm not suggesting this
with ill intentions.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.263
I don't have any grudges against him.

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:20.558
But we have to do our job. That's all.

-Excuse me.
-Yes?

00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:31.712
Where are the license exam workbooks?

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.422
Which license exam, ma'am?

00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:37.218
Well, I haven't decided yet.

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:39.762
Funny, isn't it?

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:43.391
If you just tell me
where they generally are, I'll…

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.268
-Come this way.
-Okay.

00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:52.108

-Why did he call so many times?

My gosh.

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:07.892
Why did you force him
when he doesn't want to do it?

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:09.101
[Nak-su] Don't be naive.

You've got to push kids these days.

So, is he saying he won't do it?

[Nak-su] I don't know.

00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:23.699
I congratulated him,
but he ignored my text.

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:25.284
I have no idea what he's up to.

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:26.786
So what are you saying?

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:30.289
I'll make a reservation
at the Chinese restaurant we always go to,

00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:32.416
so bring Su-gyeom there by 7:00 p.m.

No, we can't.

It won't sound as serious
if I talk to him at home.

Rumors say the audit team
is monitoring our messages.

Then they shouldn't have done that
to Mr. Heo in the first place.

Anyway, it won't hurt

00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:33.352

Is that so?

00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:31.285
Yes.

[tense music playing]

00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:39.043
So he made me do all the work,
then had lunch with Do Jin-woo?

-Did you enjoy your lunch, sir?

00:23:47.885 --> 00:23:49.261
Yes. You?

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:53.474
I didn't get to eat
since I had to go to the hospital.

00:23:54.475 --> 00:23:55.851
What did Tae-hwan say?

00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:59.647
Well, he's still a bit unstable.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:03.067
We decided to send him to Asan.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:04.276
Asan?

00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:07.905
That's great. I should've told him
while I was there.

-Nak-su.
-[hesitates] Yes?

00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:30.886
Why is your team falling
so far behind Do Jin-woo's?

00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:34.473
Are you talking about sales figures,

00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:37.393
solutions, or customer management?

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:38.852
In every area.

00:24:38.936 --> 00:24:40.104
Tell me why

00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:43.190
Team 1 is far behind Team 2
in every single area.

00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:46.860
You must have thought about it too, right?

00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:48.612
[clears throat, sniffs]

00:24:49.238 --> 00:24:50.948
Well, there are several reasons.

00:24:51.031 --> 00:24:54.034
Since the pandemic,
local governments and public offices

00:24:54.118 --> 00:24:56.453
have cut their budgets drastically, so--

00:24:56.537 --> 00:24:58.455
It's the same for every team.

00:25:00.624 --> 00:25:03.127
The disaster control staff
used to give us sales tips,

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.796
but it's difficult
to get in touch with them these days.

00:25:05.879 --> 00:25:07.089
So the groundwork is tricky--

00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:10.676
Is your team the only one
going through that right now?

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.016
Well, this isn't easy for me to say,

00:25:18.434 --> 00:25:19.601
but my team members

00:25:20.978 --> 00:25:23.856
have changed.
We're not on the same page anymore.

00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:25.774
What do you mean? How have they changed?

00:25:25.858 --> 00:25:29.737
For example,
they will suddenly take half a day off

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.488
on the day a project's due.

00:25:31.572 --> 00:25:34.575
Some just go home for personal reasons.

00:25:34.658 --> 00:25:35.743
You mean Ik-hyeon?

00:25:35.826 --> 00:25:36.827
[music fades]

00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:39.246
How do you know about that?

00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:42.124
[Jeong-tae sighs]

00:25:47.337 --> 00:25:48.797
He's my real estate mentor.

00:25:49.715 --> 00:25:50.591
What?

00:25:50.674 --> 00:25:54.511
Remember how I was wondering
whether or not to sell my old apartment

00:25:54.595 --> 00:25:56.889
because the reconstruction
was dragging on?

00:25:56.972 --> 00:25:58.891
Ik-hyeon gave me some advice.

00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:00.476
He told me to keep it.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.269
I earned quite a bit.

00:26:02.352 --> 00:26:03.729
I see.

00:26:03.812 --> 00:26:05.814
[Jeong-tae] The price is soaring now.

00:26:05.898 --> 00:26:09.401
That's why I'm renting a place
at the same complex as Do Jin-woo.

00:26:09.485 --> 00:26:12.488
I see. So that's why.

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:15.532
Did you even know
that he's a real estate expert?

00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:19.745
Well, we don't really
talk about personal stuff.

00:26:20.454 --> 00:26:23.749
[sighs] If my subordinate
had been taking so much time off,

00:26:23.832 --> 00:26:26.752
I would have asked what he was doing

00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:28.128
and what he was learning

00:26:28.212 --> 00:26:30.089
at least once.

00:26:31.006 --> 00:26:31.965
You think a team leader

00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:34.176
is someone who just stares
at reports all day?

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:37.721
A team leader should figure out
each member's strengths

00:26:37.805 --> 00:26:39.681
and help them perform their best.

00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:41.725
[sighs]

00:26:41.809 --> 00:26:45.437
That assistant manager you always
smoke with. What is he good at?

00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:46.438
What are his strengths?

00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:49.233
[hesitates] Well…

00:26:50.943 --> 00:26:53.904
[sighs] I just feel frustrated, all right?

00:26:53.987 --> 00:26:57.449
Do you think Do Jin-woo's team
is selflessly devoted to working?

00:26:57.533 --> 00:27:01.245
You've got smart people under you
who are wasting their talent right now!

Nak-su.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.876
You're a general manager.

00:27:08.502 --> 00:27:09.753
And one at a major corporation.

00:27:10.879 --> 00:27:13.966
So please, think bigger and act bigger!

00:27:15.551 --> 00:27:16.885
I'm saying this…

00:27:18.762 --> 00:27:20.430
-for your sake.
-[music fades]

[So-yeon] Doesn't ice cream
sound perfect right now?

00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:31.525
-No way.
-Let's get popsicles.

00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:33.110
I'll give you my credit card, then.

00:27:33.193 --> 00:27:35.404
-Take this--
-[So-yeon] That's no fun.

00:27:35.487 --> 00:27:38.198
Mr. Kim, you look so tired. Have this.

00:27:38.282 --> 00:27:39.408
[overlapping chatter]

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:40.450
Thanks.

00:27:40.534 --> 00:27:41.493
[Myung-heon] Come on.

00:27:41.577 --> 00:27:44.246
[Jin-woo] No, thanks. Jeez.
Then let's do this. Rock, paper, scissors!

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:45.664
I won.

00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:46.832
[So-yeon gasps]

00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:50.085
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-[Myung-heon] Congratulations.

00:27:50.169 --> 00:27:52.212
[Jin-woo] No, So-yeon was too slow.

00:27:52.296 --> 00:27:55.174
-[So-yeon] No, I wasn't.
-[Jun-seop] She wasn't.

00:27:55.257 --> 00:27:57.676
-[So-yeon] Thank you.
-[Jin-woo] I'll be back soon!

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.220
[Jin-woo] Dark chocolate for Mr. Shin.

00:28:00.304 --> 00:28:02.055
-Green tea for Myung-heon.
-[Jun-seop] Yes.

00:28:02.139 --> 00:28:04.349
-[Jin-woo] And mint chocolate for So-yeon.
-[So-yeon] Wow.

00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:05.934
-[Jin-woo] Right?
-[Myung-heon] Mr. Do.

00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:07.895
You should've taken my card
when I offered.

00:28:07.978 --> 00:28:10.314
-I'd have looked cooler.
-[Myung-heon] We'll escort you out.

00:28:10.397 --> 00:28:12.608
[lively chatter receding]

00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:14.860
What are you all doing in the afternoon?

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.696
Well,

00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:18.822
I'm--

00:28:18.906 --> 00:28:21.200
I have to write up
a security equipment list.

00:28:21.283 --> 00:28:22.826
That only takes ten minutes.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:24.870
I have to prepare
for an upcoming retention meeting.

00:28:24.953 --> 00:28:27.664
And I have to help him prepare for that.

00:28:27.748 --> 00:28:29.416
[quirky music playing]

00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:32.544
[music fades]

00:28:32.628 --> 00:28:34.087
Let's go get some coffee

00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:35.422
and some fresh air.

00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:39.927
Come on. Let's go.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.428
Oh!

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.097
Mr. Kim…

00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:45.807
[Nak-su] Yes?

00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:48.644
Are you quitting?

00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:51.980
[intriguing music playing]

00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:54.524
Is it that weird for me
to suggest getting some fresh air?

00:28:54.608 --> 00:28:56.693
-No, sir. I'm sorry.
-[music turns quirky]

00:28:56.777 --> 00:28:58.153
No, sir. Let's go.

00:28:58.237 --> 00:29:01.073
-Where should we go?
-Twosome Place? Or the new Coffee Bean?

00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:03.075
No, let's walk a bit
and go to Compose Coffee.

00:29:03.158 --> 00:29:04.326
Okay.

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:05.869
Let's have pour-over coffee.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.372
[music concludes]

00:29:08.455 --> 00:29:09.623
[sighs]

[humming]

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.011
Ha!

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:25.055
Right.

00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:26.974
It's true.

00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:29.434
Times have really changed.

00:29:30.102 --> 00:29:31.019
[clicks tongue]

00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:32.938
-Sung-gu.
-Yes?

00:29:33.021 --> 00:29:35.399
Sorry for saying something
about you buying a foreign car.

00:29:35.485 --> 00:29:37.943
You're young.
It's okay to splurge a little. I'm sorry.

00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:39.319
It's all right, sir.

00:29:39.403 --> 00:29:40.696
[chuckles]

00:29:44.324 --> 00:29:46.326
-[quirky music playing]
-These days, you know,

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:47.744
I sometimes think…

00:29:47.828 --> 00:29:51.206
When I was younger, I had seniors
that I really didn't want to be like.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:52.791
There are people like that.

00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:55.544
But if, by any chance,

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:58.088
as unlikely as it may be,

00:29:58.171 --> 00:30:03.010
you ever think of me
as someone like those seniors…

00:30:03.093 --> 00:30:05.262
[chuckles] You know, an uptight boomer--

00:30:05.345 --> 00:30:06.638
-[coffee splatters]
-Oh my.

00:30:06.722 --> 00:30:09.057
-[Song-hee coughing]
-Are you okay?

00:30:09.141 --> 00:30:10.058
Yes, I'm fine.

00:30:10.142 --> 00:30:13.103
You must have allergies.

00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:16.064
-Should we have stayed inside?
-No, it's fine. Don't worry about me, sir.

00:30:16.148 --> 00:30:17.316
You sure?

00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:19.067
-Then focus.
-Yes, sir.

00:30:19.568 --> 00:30:23.238
From now on, I'll try to be a leader
who really listens to your opinions

00:30:23.322 --> 00:30:27.534
and stays in tune with your perspectives.

00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:29.077
-All right?
-Right.

00:30:30.579 --> 00:30:33.165
Sung-gu, I'm going to have a smoke.

00:30:33.248 --> 00:30:34.833
Will you join me?

00:30:35.709 --> 00:30:37.919
Oh, I didn't bring my cigarettes.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.297
-Oh dear.
-[music fades]

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.549
Rock, paper, scissors
to see who gets them?

00:30:42.632 --> 00:30:44.134
Rock, paper, scissors--

00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:46.178
-No, I'll go get them.
-[Nak-su] It's fine.

00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:47.387
-I'll go.
-[Nak-su] You sure?

00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:49.389
-Yes.
-Take your time.

00:30:49.473 --> 00:30:50.349
[mutters]

00:30:56.855 --> 00:31:00.067
Mr. Baek told me about you, Ik-hyeon.

00:31:01.234 --> 00:31:02.944
I hear you're secretly
a real estate expert.

00:31:03.028 --> 00:31:04.654
I had no clue.

00:31:04.738 --> 00:31:05.822
No, sir.

00:31:05.906 --> 00:31:09.451
What's your take
on Seoul housing prices, Ik-hyeon?

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:10.869
[Ik-hyeon clears throat]

00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:13.497
Well, generally speaking,

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.625
various regulations have been tightened,
so there will be fewer transactions--

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:17.918
You're right.

00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:21.671
Real estate is all about
the flow of the market.

00:31:21.755 --> 00:31:22.839
As for me,

00:31:22.923 --> 00:31:26.134
I listen carefully to what taxi drivers,
restaurant owners,

00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:27.636
hikers,

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:30.806
-and people like them have to say.
-[quirky music playing]

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:33.725
You can read the market flow
from what they say.

00:31:33.809 --> 00:31:35.477
-Song-hee.
-Yes?

00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:38.688
You sometimes take a taxi
after a company dinner, right?

00:31:38.772 --> 00:31:41.441
-Yes.
-And when the driver makes small talk,

00:31:41.525 --> 00:31:43.443
you get annoyed
and put on your headphones,

00:31:43.527 --> 00:31:46.279
and you say, "Sorry,
but I want to go home quietly."

00:31:46.363 --> 00:31:47.614
-I know you do.
-I don't--

00:31:47.697 --> 00:31:49.116
You shouldn't.

00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:50.617
They're our customers too,

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.995
and they're the barometer of the public
and the market that we need to follow.

00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:55.122
-Okay?
-Okay.

00:31:55.205 --> 00:31:56.998
You tend to do that.
Even when I'm talking--

00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:57.958
-[Sung-gu] Sir.
-Hey.

00:31:58.041 --> 00:32:00.168
-I brought my cigarettes.
-What took you so long?

00:32:00.252 --> 00:32:02.045
-I'll be back.
-[Ik-hyeon] Yes, sir.

00:32:02.129 --> 00:32:03.422
[in English] I'll be back.

00:32:03.489 --> 00:32:05.407
[in Korean] Don't talk behind my back.

00:32:06.216 --> 00:32:07.968
-[music concludes]
-[Song-hee sighing]

00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:10.804
He's not planning
on doing this every day, is he?

00:32:10.887 --> 00:32:12.764
[Ik-hyeon]
He'll keep it up for a week tops.

00:32:12.848 --> 00:32:15.142
I'm dying to go back to work now.

00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:16.768
Then I guess he achieved his goal.

00:32:16.852 --> 00:32:18.103
[sighs]

00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:20.021
What's gotten into him today?

00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:22.649
Things are already tense
at the office because of Mr. Heo.

00:32:24.109 --> 00:32:25.944
That's why he's doing this.

00:32:26.027 --> 00:32:27.112
[sighs]

00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:29.197
He's coming.

00:32:29.281 --> 00:32:31.408
[in singsong] So tense.

00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:33.785
[grunts, yelps]

00:32:33.869 --> 00:32:36.705
Oh, I want you guys to know this too.

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:39.749
-We didn't hear what you said over there.
-[Nak-su] Right.

00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:41.334
-Sung-gu!
-Yes, sir!

00:32:41.418 --> 00:32:42.961
-[Nak-su] Hurry up.
-Yes, sir.

00:32:43.044 --> 00:32:44.921
He's so tense.

00:32:45.005 --> 00:32:46.006
Well…

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:49.468
-[Sung-gu grunts]
-To put it briefly,

00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:53.138
I will support your creativity
and your bold ideas!

00:32:53.221 --> 00:32:55.390
-[daring music playing]
-I'll actively support ideas

00:32:55.474 --> 00:32:58.685
born not from the obligation to work

00:32:58.768 --> 00:33:00.812
but from a bright vision
for our company's future!

00:33:00.896 --> 00:33:02.314
What do you say?

00:33:02.397 --> 00:33:04.191
-Wow.
-That's nice.

00:33:04.274 --> 00:33:05.817
-Awesome!
-[team chuckles]

00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:08.236
Then how about

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.281
you bring in some new product ideas
by next week?

00:33:12.073 --> 00:33:15.160
-[music builds]
-About five ideas each.

00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:17.120
-[music quietens]
-[hesitates] Five?

00:33:17.204 --> 00:33:18.747
Don't feel too pressured.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.166
But bring ideas
that can deliver solid results.

00:33:21.249 --> 00:33:23.627
Something concrete that we can show HQ.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:27.297
Work should have clear results.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.590
Got it?

00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:30.717
Let's go and work our butts off.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.135
-Yes, sir.
-[Nak-su] All right.

00:33:32.219 --> 00:33:33.929
-[laughs]
-[quirky music playing]

00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:37.265

-[music concludes]
-[sighs contentedly, whoops]

JEALOUSY, MY STRENGTH

ART THAT CAPTURES TIME
SENSE THAT FILLS SPACE

00:33:54.074 --> 00:33:56.284
Wow, I wanted to see this.

00:33:57.869 --> 00:33:59.079
It was pretty nice.

00:33:59.955 --> 00:34:02.582
I wanted to see
Palestine's Ballet Academy.

00:34:03.416 --> 00:34:05.460
What did you think of that photo?

00:34:05.544 --> 00:34:06.878
[Su-gyeom] That was so sudden.

00:34:08.255 --> 00:34:11.132
I'm not sure.
I didn't get to see that one.

00:34:11.216 --> 00:34:13.301
-[quirky music playing]
-Hmm? That's impossible.

00:34:13.385 --> 00:34:15.470
That photo is the size of an entire wall.

00:34:16.221 --> 00:34:18.223
Amid the horrors of war, the children--

00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:20.642
Oh, to be honest,

00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:23.186
I have a trauma related to war.

00:34:23.937 --> 00:34:27.274
So I rushed past photos
of Palestine or Ukraine

00:34:27.357 --> 00:34:30.277
and I didn't see that one. [chuckles]

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.320
Ballerina? I mean, Ballet Academy?

00:34:32.404 --> 00:34:35.448
I didn't know there was a photo like that.

00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:38.702
[laughs nervously]

What am I even doing?

00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:52.799
Did you say he interviewed

00:42:47.027 --> 00:42:49.108
[in Korean]
Wow, it made such a difference.

00:42:49.192 --> 00:42:50.318
You've mastered it now.

00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:51.944
[Jeong-tae chuckles]

00:42:53.696 --> 00:42:54.989
Why isn't it coming out?

00:43:00.161 --> 00:43:01.496
I should pay you for lessons.

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:02.789
-[laughs]
-[golf ball thwacks]

00:43:02.872 --> 00:43:05.625
So an executive's wife can't work, then?

00:43:05.708 --> 00:43:09.128
-I can only do chores at home?
-I'm not saying you shouldn't work.

00:43:09.212 --> 00:43:11.839
You're trying to speculate in real estate.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.592
What are you talking about?

00:43:14.675 --> 00:43:16.219
It's not like that these days.

00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:17.970
If you want to work, do something else.

00:43:18.054 --> 00:43:20.473
There are lots of things
housewives can do.

00:43:20.556 --> 00:43:22.850
You want me to do part-time jobs
like making dolls?

00:43:22.934 --> 00:43:25.019
Yes, that's a good idea.

00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:27.814
You think it's easy?
That requires skills too.

00:43:28.356 --> 00:43:30.650
Do you want me
to just stay home and do nothing?

00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:32.527
What am I supposed to do?

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:36.364
How about flower arrangements?
That's nice.

00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:38.241
Doesn't that require skills too?

00:43:38.324 --> 00:43:41.327
Jeez. Stop it.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:42.995
That's enough, all right?

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.416
-Kim Su-gyeom.
-Yes?

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.544
Don't waste your time on useless stuff

00:43:49.627 --> 00:43:51.587
and take the opportunity--

00:43:51.671 --> 00:43:53.589
I got a job offer.

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:56.801
A job offer?

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:58.845
Yes, at a startup company.

00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:01.013
What kind of company?

00:44:01.764 --> 00:44:04.058
They're working on their brand value…

00:44:04.142 --> 00:44:05.226
[Nak-su] What's their name?

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:08.146
What's the name?

00:44:08.938 --> 00:44:10.398
Jealousy, My Strength.

00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:14.652
-[scoffs] Jealousy…
-Is it a matchmaking agency?

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:16.988
-It's not that.
-[Nak-su] …My Strength.

00:44:17.071 --> 00:44:18.406
Wait, this is a film.

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:22.285
[inhales deeply] Jealousy, My Strength
as a company name?

00:44:22.368 --> 00:44:25.371
How did that company find you
and give you an offer?

00:44:25.454 --> 00:44:27.707
Well, just through acquaintances.

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:29.458
Here it is. Jealousy, My Strength.

00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:30.877
They even got the grammar wrong.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.003
BEGIN JEALOUSY EXPERIMENT

00:44:32.086 --> 00:44:33.212
What is this?

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:36.382
[chuckles softly]

00:44:37.758 --> 00:44:39.260
-Jeez.
-[cell phone clatters]

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:41.137
[sniffs] My goodness.

00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:44.056
So how is this company making money?

00:44:44.932 --> 00:44:47.059
They're figuring out
a revenue model right now.

00:44:47.143 --> 00:44:48.519
What would you do in this company?

00:44:48.603 --> 00:44:49.812
Be jealous?

00:44:49.896 --> 00:44:51.355
I'd be the CDO…

00:44:51.439 --> 00:44:53.149
CTO? You, the Chief Technology Officer?

00:44:53.232 --> 00:44:55.401
No, the CDO.

00:44:55.484 --> 00:44:57.570
It's short for Chief Destruction Officer.

00:44:57.653 --> 00:44:59.530
Destruction? Like destroying things?

00:45:00.656 --> 00:45:03.743
Yes. Tom Peters used that term
when talking about innovative management.

00:45:03.826 --> 00:45:06.704
"In the 21st century,
you can't succeed by just improving."

00:45:06.787 --> 00:45:07.830
"Destruction is cool."

00:45:07.914 --> 00:45:10.374
So what is a CDO?

00:45:10.458 --> 00:45:12.710
So, it's short
for Chief Destruction Officer.

00:45:12.793 --> 00:45:14.962
What will you be destroying as chief?

00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:17.965
I want to do this.

00:45:18.049 --> 00:45:19.550
Do what?

00:45:19.634 --> 00:45:22.178
-The CDO.
-So what on earth is a CDO?

00:45:25.097 --> 00:45:27.642
You haven't been asked
to invest money or anything, right?

00:45:27.725 --> 00:45:30.561
There are a lot
of cryptocurrency scams these days.

00:45:30.645 --> 00:45:33.105
No, it's not like that.
These guys have vision.

00:45:33.189 --> 00:45:34.607
[Nak-su] Vision, my ass.

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:38.945
[sighs] My son received a job offer
as a Chief Destruction Officer

00:45:39.028 --> 00:45:42.156
from a startup company
named Jealousy, My Strength?

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.449
[laughs] Unbelievable.

00:45:43.532 --> 00:45:45.034
I have no idea

00:45:45.117 --> 00:45:47.620
where to start explaining.

00:45:47.703 --> 00:45:50.206
Dad, I don't want to
join a major corporation.

00:45:50.289 --> 00:45:51.999
-What are you saying?
-[tense music playing]

00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:54.001
You think it's easy
to join a major corporation?

00:45:54.085 --> 00:45:55.586
I want to find my own thing.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:58.089
Is being a Chief Destruction Officer
something only you can do?

00:45:58.172 --> 00:46:01.217
All major corporations also started off
as small startup companies.

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.178
No, my company started off
as a major corporation.

00:46:04.262 --> 00:46:06.973
Companies like Amazon and Google
started from a garage.

00:46:07.056 --> 00:46:09.433
Amazon was an internet bookshop,

00:46:09.517 --> 00:46:12.687
and Google had a clear goal
as a search engine.

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.647
Worthless flashy startups

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.399
can't be compared to companies like that.

00:46:16.482 --> 00:46:19.151
If they're lacking something,
I can help them grow.

00:46:19.235 --> 00:46:20.236
I'm your son.

00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:21.404
Am I worthless too?

00:46:21.487 --> 00:46:23.364
The problem is that
you're refusing to take

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:25.157
the great opportunities
I'm making for you!

00:46:25.241 --> 00:46:27.410
I've done everything you told me to
since I was little.

00:46:27.493 --> 00:46:29.954
Workbook programs, tutoring,
cram schools, retaking the CSAT.

00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:32.832
Is there anything I've refused to do
in the past 20 years?

00:46:32.915 --> 00:46:36.335
I can tell what fits my aptitude
and what doesn't now.

00:46:36.419 --> 00:46:37.712
You've never had a proper job.

00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:40.256
How would you know
what fits your aptitude or not?

00:46:41.674 --> 00:46:43.217
Just join the military, then!

00:46:43.301 --> 00:46:45.469
-[knocking on door]
-[Nak-su] What nonsense.

00:46:47.346 --> 00:46:48.264
Excuse me.

00:46:49.015 --> 00:46:50.850
Should I bring your food later?

00:46:50.933 --> 00:46:53.227
-No, it's fine. Please bring it in.
-[owner] Okay.

00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:54.312
[cart wheels rattling]

00:46:54.395 --> 00:46:55.771
[exhales deeply]

00:46:56.272 --> 00:46:57.565
All right.

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:00.568
I got you four more buns.

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:02.528
[Nak-su] They look delicious.

00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:05.614
Meiran's stir-fries are the best.

00:47:05.698 --> 00:47:06.991
[chuckles]

00:47:07.074 --> 00:47:08.326
Here you go.

00:47:09.243 --> 00:47:11.454
Do you eat out somewhere else these days?

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:13.247
What?

00:47:13.331 --> 00:47:15.207
Come here instead of Meiran.

00:47:15.291 --> 00:47:16.667
I'll offer you lots of extras.

00:47:17.918 --> 00:47:19.503
What? Meiran…

00:47:19.587 --> 00:47:21.422
Please enjoy your food.

00:47:26.093 --> 00:47:27.011
What was that?

00:47:27.094 --> 00:47:30.348
[hesitates] Where's Meiran, honey?

00:47:31.057 --> 00:47:31.932
Meiran…

00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:35.728
That's the Chinese restaurant
near my company.

00:47:37.188 --> 00:47:38.814
How did you know to come here, then?

00:47:38.898 --> 00:47:42.276
You told us to come to the place
near our house. This is Ssangyonggak.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.153
This place is Ssangyonggak?

00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:46.155
SSANGYONGGAK

00:47:46.238 --> 00:47:47.740
-Oh dear!
-[Ha-jin] Wait.

00:47:47.823 --> 00:47:50.076
Then did you make a reservation
at Meiran, not this place?

00:47:50.159 --> 00:47:52.078
-[sighs] Oh man.
-[Ha-jin scoffs]

00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:55.289
This is why I worry these days.

00:47:55.373 --> 00:47:57.792
-[sighs]
-[chuckling] I can't believe it.

00:47:58.417 --> 00:48:00.419
I guess I really am getting old.

00:48:00.503 --> 00:48:01.754
I got confused.

00:48:01.837 --> 00:48:04.006
-My goodness.
-[Ha-jin] Right. You are old.

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:05.758
Here, eat some stir-fry.

00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:07.760
Su-gyeom, eat up while it's warm.

00:48:07.843 --> 00:48:09.220
Apologize, Dad.

00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:11.097
What?

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:15.476
You should apologize
to that employee when we leave.

00:48:16.769 --> 00:48:17.770
For what?

00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:19.772
You made a mistake and blamed him for it.

00:48:19.855 --> 00:48:22.733
You even shouted at him and insulted him.

00:48:23.609 --> 00:48:24.944
I think you should apologize.

00:48:25.027 --> 00:48:26.487
-Let's eat.
-Apologize.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:27.446
Just eat.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.657
You said you had to get
to the bottom of it.

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.909
Now you know that it was your mistake.

00:48:31.992 --> 00:48:33.619
Hey, I'm always busy working.

00:48:33.702 --> 00:48:36.038
-So I might make mistakes.
-That's why you should apologize!

00:48:36.122 --> 00:48:37.081
Hey!

00:48:38.833 --> 00:48:40.084
I'm a regular here.

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:42.711
I've brought you and your mom,

00:48:42.795 --> 00:48:44.755
my friends,
and even had company dinners here.

00:48:44.839 --> 00:48:46.090
I boosted sales for them!

00:48:46.173 --> 00:48:48.551
What does that have to do
with yelling at an employee?

00:48:48.634 --> 00:48:49.802
Dealing with complaints

00:48:49.885 --> 00:48:51.804
comes with the job
in the service industry.

00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:54.181
It wasn't a complaint.
You just made a mistake!

00:48:54.265 --> 00:48:56.308
-[loud bang]
-You punk!

00:48:57.184 --> 00:48:58.644
[music fades]

00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:01.439
[sobs softly]

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:05.568
[sighs]

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.489
[sniffles] What's so great, Dad?

00:49:12.116 --> 00:49:14.285
You survived as a general manager
at a big company,

00:49:14.368 --> 00:49:17.455
bought an apartment in Seoul,
and sent me to college. So what?

00:49:18.497 --> 00:49:19.748
Don't you see…

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:25.504
the way your own son
is looking at you right now?

00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:29.341
Doesn't that scare you?

00:49:32.595 --> 00:49:35.014
[melancholic music playing]

00:49:41.312 --> 00:49:42.354
[sniffs]

00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:44.815
I'll excuse myself first.

00:49:45.858 --> 00:49:46.901
Where are you going?

00:49:47.902 --> 00:49:49.361
You should eat!

00:49:51.572 --> 00:49:52.740
Damn it.

00:49:56.577 --> 00:49:57.828
[Ha-jin] I'm full.

00:49:58.662 --> 00:49:59.747
Eat this by yourself.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:03.792
I feel ashamed as a mother.

00:50:03.876 --> 00:50:05.961
My son said such things to his father,

00:50:06.879 --> 00:50:08.923
and I have nothing to say to him.

00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:11.467
Eat up.

00:50:13.469 --> 00:50:15.304
Where are you going? Sit down.

00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:17.223
Honey.

00:50:17.306 --> 00:50:19.517
[melancholic music continues]

00:50:26.732 --> 00:50:27.608
[cutlery clattering]

00:50:27.691 --> 00:50:28.567
[sighs]

00:50:29.527 --> 00:50:30.611
[sighs heavily]

00:50:31.111 --> 00:50:32.446
[knocking on door]

00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:37.368
Excuse me.

00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:43.582
I'm sorry about earlier.
