Lu!

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.060
(In Surgery)

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.110
How could this happen?

00:01:46.244 --> 00:01:48.670
Why didn't you tell me about
what happened in the company?

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.390
I'm sorry, Mr. Xingchen.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.760
Lu's been in there for four hours.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.800
I'm really scared
something might happen to him.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.040
Don't worry. This is the best hospital.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.240
He'll be fine.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.520
I'd rather it be me lying in there.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.150
How could this happen?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.040
Lu Xingchen,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.670
let Mo Li take care of his wound first,
all right?

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.110
The police are already
tracking down the driver.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.990
Mo Li's injury looks serious.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.920
Sorry.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.960
How's he, Doctor?

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.480
He's stable for now,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.040
but needs to be closely monitored.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.670
The patient will be moved to the ICU.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.933
Who will sign the consent form?

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.830
I'm his wife.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.390
But we're not married yet.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.870
I'll sign.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.830
I'm his son.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.790
Will my dad be okay?

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.760
Wait for further notice.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.030
(Gu Liusu,)

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.030
(two people you most care about
are both a mess right now.)

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.120
(You need to calm down.)

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.270
(You must calm down.)

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.620
(Nurses' Station)

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.000
Alright.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.230
Sorry.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.790
It's fine. I can do it myself.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.640
You haven't left?

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.760
Eat something.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.830
No need.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.080
Lu Xingchen,

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.080
you can't collapse.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.320
Xinghan needs you now.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.590
Yes.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:12.560
I know.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.230
I'll be right outside.

00:06:16.466 --> 00:06:17.680
Call me if you need anything.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.830
Alright.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.470
Thank you.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.790
Dad.

00:06:56.866 --> 00:06:58.000
You're tired, aren't you?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.350
Take a good rest.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.680
Funny, isn't it?

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.350
I've been so busy at the office

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.000
these past few days.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.830
When I was a kid, I thought

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.150
I ate alone,

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.640
slept alone,

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.000
and played games alone

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.680
because you all didn't like me.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.590
Now I know

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.590
I misunderstood you.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.390
You can hear me, right?

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.120
Dad.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.830
All these years,

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.200
we've never really had

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.880
a proper

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.590
and heart-to-heart talk.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.590
How about this?

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.320
When you wake up...

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.560
Once you wake up,

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:16.680
I will

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.910
take over Xinghan.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.520
No more screw-ups.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.790
I'll do anything

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.120
you say.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.870
I'm begging you, Dad.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.510
I've lost Mom.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.750
I can't lose you too.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.320
Dad.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.400
Please wake up.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.710
Please.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.560
Baozhu.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.630
I'm good.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.470
What's with that look?

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.470
I'm fine, really.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.960
Go home.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.750
You've been here all night.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.080
I can take care of myself.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.320
Are you sure?

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.510
Yes.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.750
Go home.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.080
Alright.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.750
If you're fine, I'll go.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.750
I'm a grown-up.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.040
I'll take care of myself.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.230
Go on.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.680
Go.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:57.630
Come on.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.750
Don't ask me to walk you out.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.750
Quick.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:10.470
Go on.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.630
(I knew they were
all pretending that day.)

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.800
(But the adult's world is cruel.)

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.560
(Respecting Baozhu's lie)

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.750
(is the only thing I can.)

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.750
You know what to do, do you?

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.110
Yes.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.680
Let me check on my wife, please.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.990
Dear, you're saved.

00:11:04.466 --> 00:11:06.280
We've got the money
for the kidney transplant.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.750
You must wake up.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.222
(City News. Latest Update)
Did you drink that night?

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.620
(Earlier, the president
of Xinghan Group)

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.460

in a development area.)

(The driver has turned himself in
to the police.)

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.140
(He claimed he fled the scene
out of fear.)

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.230
(Police tests revealed
his blood alcohol level)

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.560
(exceeded the legal limit.)

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.370

as drunk driving.)

Lu Jianhua, remains in a coma.)

(We'll continue to bring you updates
on this story.)

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:47.320
Ms. Gu.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.440
Yes?

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.630
This is the PR plan we prepared
for Xinghan.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.470
Please review it.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.777
First, justify the demolition.
Second, protect the company's image.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.870
Okay.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.800
We'll proceed with this.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.280
Okay.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.870
You've worked hard.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.230
Not at all.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.160
