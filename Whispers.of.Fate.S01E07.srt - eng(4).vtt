[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.920
[Episode 7]

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.500
This is a trace of sword energy

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.350
left by Ancestor Xuanqing
and sealed within

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.479
the Yanhuang Sword.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.130
With this sword energy nurturing you all,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.460
your skills will surely advance further.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.860
The Westwind Slashing Wildfire

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.070
is too powerful and might hurt

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.400
my fellow cultivators.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.360
So today, on the sword stage,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.200
I shall use other techniques instead.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.800
Victory or defeat doesn't matter.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.259
Just a friendly exchange.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.240
The Sword Phoenix awakens!

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.030
The Sword King reigns!

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.000
The Sword Phoenix awakens!

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.000
The Sword King reigns!

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.120
It's the Sword Duel Festival
in Sword King City.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.560
Aside from allied shipping guilds,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.590
entry into the city

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.990
requires an invitation.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.540
Told you you were late.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.870
The Sword Opening has started.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.470
To enter Sword King City now,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.800
you need an invitation.

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:31.750
Looks like

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.270
I'm still too early.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.680
Too early?

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.870
You're late.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.030
Watch and learn.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.020
I am Chi Yun,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.770
Chief of Huoyun Fortress.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.750
I've come to pay my respects
to Sword King Yu.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.420
However,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.400
I left in a hurry and forgot

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.730
to bring my invitation.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.520
Please,

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:51.810
do us a favor.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.310
Huoyun Fortress?

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.310
Never heard of it!

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.360
Some no-name sect

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.240
trying to freeload

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.280
in Sword King City?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.810
Get lost!

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.360
Chi Yun,

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.030
it seems Sword King City

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.400
doesn't care much for your reputation

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.360
as the Cloud.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.870
Foxy Tang,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.000
how big a scene should I make?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.840
That depends on how capable

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.840
you are.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.750
No private fights

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.810
in Sword King City!

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.850
Commander,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.410
they're trying to force their way in
without invitations.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.030
During the Sword Duel Festival,

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.400
no one enters
the city

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.600
without an invitation,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.950
not even the Cloud.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.960
I heard that

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.400
the Sword Duel Festival welcomes
heroes from all over the world.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.700
But now it seems there is

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.300
a clear hierarchy after all.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.640
Go get your punishment.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.190
Yes.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.990
He acted recklessly.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.560
Please forgive him.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.790
However, this is the rule
of Sword King City.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.640
If you don't have invitations,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.750
I'm afraid

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.460
I cannot let you in.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.630
What if I

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.950
insist on entering today?

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.970
Wanqiao Chamber is entering!

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.560
Clear the way!

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.630
Wanqiao Chamber is entering!

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.240
Clear the way!

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.160
The Master of Wanqiao Chamber

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.750
congratulates the Yu family
on the festival

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.310
and presents 10 baskets of pearls.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.680
During the festival,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.390
all purchases in the city's shops

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.600
are on the house.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.000
What a show-off.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.630
Wanqiao Chamber's treasure ship
has arrived.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.510
Sir, I think

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.630
you should step aside for now.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.500
The winds are high,
and the waves are rough.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.830
Perfect for traveling.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.130
Your small boat is packed with people.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.330
Beware of capsizing.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.120
Watch out!

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.530
You're about to crash!

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.360
Stop!

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.600
Greetings, Master.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.050
You're the Master of Wanqiao Chamber?

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.390
Well,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.800
since I can't enter Sword King City

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.040
as Tang Lici,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.390
then I'll just have to

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.510
borrow the invitation

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.640
of Wanqiao Chamber.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.600
Just now,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.680
I didn't know
you were the Master of Wanqiao Chamber.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.010
I may have offended you.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.000
I apologize.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.320
But I don't understand.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.200
Why would you, with an invitation in hand,

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.070
still make such a big scene?

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.600
If I hadn't made a scene,

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.480
how else could I see

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.810
where the problem lies?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.260
Commander,

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.120
have we just offended

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.630
the Master of Wanqiao Chamber?

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.760
Go tell Sword King Yu

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:44.800
that I'm eccentric by nature

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.700
and dislike being seen,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.930
so there's no need to blame anyone.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.390
Guys,

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.050
please get on board.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.670
He's showing off again.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.370
Foxy Tang,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.240
this is

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.360
way tooâ€¦

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.400
luxurious.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.300
H-How much money

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.480
do you actually have?

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.210
I don't know.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.360
Never counted it.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.800
I remember you were never

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.200
interested in business.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.670
What's your plan for running

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.190
Wanqiao Chamber?

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.440
Does one have to live

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.610
only for what one's interested in?

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.090
Tang Sen.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.480
Yes.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.530
Help my friends settle in.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.200
Make sure they feel

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.040
right at home.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.490
Yes, Master.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.480
This young man's talent

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.340
is impressive.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:16.600
He's lasted 30 minutes

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.950
against Sword King Yu.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.250
Impressive!

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.070
The Sword King is formidable!

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.000
You're too kind.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.730
You have great potential.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.960
Work hard, and you will

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.500
achieve great things.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.230
Look at him.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.990
The Sword King gave him personal pointers,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.800
yet he just walked away without a word.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.710
How rude.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.890
What's talent worth

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.060
if you don't have manners?

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.610
Zhong, did you see that?

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.150
Sword King Yu just aimed for

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.080
his vital point.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.660
And his angle was extremely tricky.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.670
Good thing we had a clear view

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.320
from here.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.870
If Mr. Lin hadn't

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.330
dodged at the last second,

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.140
he'd be crippledâ€”

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.360
if not dead.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.290
The path of martial arts runs deep.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.490
Talent is like a small boat.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.730
It can carry you or sink you.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.120
One can't

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.920
rely solely on talent

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.180
and lose humility.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.390
There are

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.390
no shortcuts.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.440
But why did Sword King Yu

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.840
go that hard on him?

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.270
Perhaps out of jealousy.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.270
Exactly.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.930
Does anyone else

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.730
wish to come up and compete?

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:31.580
Master,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.320
here is the account book
for the six months

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.320
you've been away.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.480
Any word from my foster father?

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.740
The imperial father-in-law says

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.970
everything in Wanqiao Chamber

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.100
is at your disposal.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:51.470
By the way,

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.120
Miss Shei

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.720
seems interested in bookkeeping.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.250
Got it.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.400
Master,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.160
Miss Shei requests to see you.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.540
Now that you're in the city,

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.510
why not just visit Sword King Manor?

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.610
No need to visit in person.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.720
The bigger the stir I made today,

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.200
the more attention I'd draw

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.780
to myself.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.490
You don't just want the attention

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.220
of Sword King Yu, right?

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.360
Since I've come,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.970
he'll definitely come too.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.870
What's going on?

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.030
Yeah, it's so cold.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.320
It suddenly got cold.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.390
Indeed.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.270
Why did it suddenly get cold?

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:06.910
Yeah.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.000
It's snowing.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.240
It's snowing.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.440
I'm Xue Xianzi.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.510
I've long heard of your name, Sword King.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.170
Please give me some guidance.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.320
Xue Xianzi?

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:29.790
Is that really Xue Xianzi?

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:30.790
Is it an impostor?

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.320
He's acting mysteriously.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.580
He must be an impostor.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:35.800
What a surprise.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.500
Xue Xianzi,
the Hermit of Snow, has come too.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.630
You're a master of the sword.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.090
I don't dare presume

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.500
to offer any guidance.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:12:59.150
I can't say

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.280
you are wrong.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.630
You flatter me, Sword King.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.890
The Yu family has produced
ten generations of Sword Kings,

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.240
while I've only been known

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.240
for a few short decades.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:26.870
How could my pale snow

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.190
ever compare to your blazing flame?

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:30.790
How arrogant!

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:31.910
Is heâ€¦

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.390
truly Xue Xianzi?

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.610
I've met him beforeâ€”

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.550
once in the jianghu

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.720
with my senior.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.320
That is

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:40.670
indeed him.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.720
Please,

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.240
do me the honor.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
You flatter me.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.870
We both share a love for swordsmanship.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.600
A friendly match

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.630
is all.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.510
Please.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.750
Then, Sword King,

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.480
prepare yourself

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.410
for this strike.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.270
The Hermit of Snow.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.970
It really is him.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.770
Sword King, let's see if you

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.270
can withstand this strike

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.080
from me.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.440
It seems

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.140
everyone has seen

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.050
Sword King Yu's
Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.040
Are you alright?

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.600
Oh, no.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:44.840
He lost.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.090
He lost?

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.310
What's happening?

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:50.590
You really are

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.550
the top swordsman of our timeâ€”

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.010
Yu Qifeng, the Sword King.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:54.790
I've

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.270
lost.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.110
Looks like Xue Xianzi

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.780
is here to stir up trouble.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.520
Yu Qifeng's Westwind Slashing Wildfire

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.530
truly lives up to its reputation.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.700
I am

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.890
so impressed.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.070
Westwind Slashing Wildfire?

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.400
Miss Shei, please go inside first.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.200
I have some matters to attend to.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.390
All right, Mr. Tang.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.670
Shen.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.510
It's time.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.680
Let's go.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:17:00.070
[Tianyan Sword Wall, Sword King City]

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:06.510
Tianyan Sword Wall.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.910
So this is Yu Xuanqing's sword essence.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.680
It's truly powerful.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.510
What a pity.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:15.880
This secret legacy exists,

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.440
yet there's no worthy successor.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.040
The grand Sword King City

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.410
has long been blinded by greed.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:23.680
Otherwise,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.240
how could it have been tainted

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.640
by the Blood Ghost Pills?

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.109
Why did you

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.390
bring me here?

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.330
To rattle the grassâ€¦

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.450
and scare out the snake.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.200
There's indeed more to it than it seems.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.770
The essence of the Sword Phoenix?

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.890
You are not of this realm.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.540
Why have you set foot in this realm?

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.800
Only when one abandons the mortal flesh

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.130
and comes between reality and the void

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.060
can one glimpse the past and the future.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.280
I am Tang Lici.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.480
Please grant me your guidance,
Sword Phoenix.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:08.710
A golden eye on the foreheadâ€¦

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:09.920
Yique Yinyang,

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:11.140
it's you.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.420
You're actually still alive.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.310
Since that's the case,

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.770
I shall take your life here!

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.720
Such powerâ€¦

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.520
That's the Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.300
Westwind Slashing Wildfire?

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:56.720
But

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.060
why is it different from the one

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.060
Sword King Yu unleashed earlier?

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.550
Yeah, it looks different.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.310
What's going on?

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.070
Indeed.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.440
Sword King Yu's sword essence
is as dark as night.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.000
Why is this one crimson red?

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.620
Who cares what color it is?

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.670
This sword essence

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.200
has heaven-shaking power.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.200
Truly,

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.810
the young phoenix

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.120
outshines the old one.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.970
Sword King!

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:20.820
Sword King,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.780
an outsider breached
the Tianyan Sword Wall.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.190
We're not powerful enough to get close

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.160
and don't know what to do.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.360
We await your orders.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.950
The Yu family's
most powerful sword technique

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.810
has been mastered by an outsider.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.690
This is going to be interesting.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:38.510
An outsider broke in.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:39.550
Who was it?

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.510
Someone actually had the nerve

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.000
to break into Sword King City's
forbidden ground.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.270
How audacious!

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.070
Sword King,

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:49.960
you must punish them

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.030
and teach that person

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.910
a good lesson.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.700
The Yu family has
taken in disciples for a centuryâ€”

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.630
all to pass on the way of the sword

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.060
and benefit the jianghu.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.830
If someone

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.160
from outside

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.890
truly glimpsed its mysteries,

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.200
my ancestors' efforts

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.400
wouldn't be in vain.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:09.920
However,

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.790
the Westwind Slashing Wildfire
is extremely profound.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.640
Without years of diligent practice,

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.570
how could anyone

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.960
master it so easily?

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.690
To find out whether that person

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.220
has really mastered it,

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:21.440
we just need

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.570
to go and see for ourselves.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:24.950
Exactly!

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.030
Sword King,

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.310
broaden our horizons.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:28.200
Am I right?

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:28.680
Yes.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.480
That's right.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.010
Please broaden our horizons.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.960
Since you all are so interested,

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.680
then follow me

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:37.940
to meet

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.680
this brave trespasser.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.550
-Great!
-Great!

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:42.790
-Thank you, Sword King.
-Thank you, Sword King.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.990
You're magnanimous.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.060
Zhong,

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.580
there's really someone up there.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:19.440
Everyone,

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.410
the winds here are too strong.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.560
Please wait here.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:24.030
I'll go ask

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.830
the friend up there to come down.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.350
Darn it. I'm stopped here again.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.100
Why could that person go up?

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.480
Friend,

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.400
understanding the sword essence
is dangerous.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.920
I shall not disturb you.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.090
Please turn around.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.070
You entered Sword King City

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.350
without announcing yourself

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.900
and trespassed into the forbidden ground.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.560
That's quite disrespectful.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.160
No matter how you went up

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.160
the Tianyan Sword Wall by luck,

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.170
now that the master is here,

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.510
you should at least
turn around for a talk.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.240
Indeed. He's not even turning around.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.070
So rude!

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.240
You're actually

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.500
also a disciple of Zhoudi Tower.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.280
Head Fang was a man of great wisdom.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.160
He must have had his reasons

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.960
for accepting you as a disciple.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.600
This is the Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.730
Watch it carefully.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:34.750
Whether you can master it

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.510
is up to you.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:45.600
Ignorant brat,

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.960
you're overestimating yourself!

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.980
â™ª Vast lands â™ª

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.430
Shadow Concealment Technique?

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.650
â™ª And boundless skies â™ª

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.920
â™ª The world is in turmoil â™ª

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.710
â™ª Storms are rising â™ª

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.350
Shen Langhun

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:27.950
from Fallen Shisan Tower?

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.160
â™ª Heroes stand proud â™ª

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:30.340
After barely making it up here,

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.240
â™ª Their will is like steel â™ª

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.160
you tried to strike from the shadows.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:34.890
You don't deserve

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:35.960
â™ª Through storm and frost,
the swords they wield â™ª

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.340
to be called Sword King.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.030
â™ª Cutting down all evil
between heaven and earth â™ª

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.570
â™ª Flames of war sweep across the world â™ª

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.660
â™ª Good has not yet triumphed over evil â™ª

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:49.160
â™ª The moon in the water â™ª

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:52.140
â™ª Holds lost dreams â™ª

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.510
â™ª The world's at the fingertips â™ª

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.990
â™ª Hidden within a warrior's heart â™ª

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.400
â™ª The endless seas and lands â™ª

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:06.790
â™ª Await my burning passion â™ª

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:15.040
â™ª Facing swords and blades, I roar alone â™ª

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:21.540
â™ª With supreme power,
I roam free under heaven â™ª

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:22.240
â™ª Mad and laughing
like Buddha or a demon â™ª

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.840
Such refined sword essence.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.590
His sword essence has actually suppressed

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:26.680
â™ª A roar, and winds and clouds howl â™ª

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.540
and dissipated the strong winds.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.490
â™ª No madness, no fire â™ª

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.780
â™ª How can one be called a hero? â™ª

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.440
Isn't thatâ€¦

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.780
the Westwind Slashing Wildfire?

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.920
I unleashed

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.880
the Westwind Slashing Wildfire just now.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:00.370
What do you think of it, Sword King Yu?

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.840
It truly was
the Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.040
It was the Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.730
Are you alright?

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.290
I spent 50,000 taels of gold

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.100
and fought my way into the tower
to get you.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.430
I can't let you die here.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.420
I thought I was mistaken.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.570
It really is you, Mr. Tang.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.770
Miss Zhong.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.140
Zhong,

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.550
so this is Mr. Tang Lici,

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.960
the one you mentioned?

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:28.480
I recognize him.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.070
He's the one
who summoned

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.920
Wanqiao Chamber's treasure ship

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.240
outside the city just now.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.240
He is the Master of Wanqiao Chamber!

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.790
He is the Master of Wanqiao Chamber?

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:37.590
He's so young.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.510
It's him.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.680
He is the Master of Wanqiao Chamber!

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.070
Turns out Mr. Tang
is

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.510
none other than the famed

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.040
Master of Wanqiao Chamber.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:51.720
Back in Yanmen,

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.410
when I captured Jiang Qingyu,

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.580
I didn't expect

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.910
our next meeting

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:58.370
would be like this.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.540
Deliberately hiding your identity,

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.070
hiring a notorious

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.200
jianghu assassin,

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.350
and trespassing on
my family's forbidden groundâ€”

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.920
was it

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.750
all to meddle in Jiang Qingyu's case?

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:11.280
Exactly.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.290
The case will be judged fairly.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.830
How could Mr. Tang abuse his power

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.030
and be so aggressive?

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:16.800
Right.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.830
He even brought an assassin.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.230
Planning to use
both carrot and stick, huh?

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.550
Sword King Yu, in one statement,

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.350
you were wrong about two things.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.200
First,

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.000
the one who captured Jiang Qingyu

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.960
was me.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:37.120
Tang Lici captured him?

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:37.920
What?

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:39.240
Didn't Sword King Yu say

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.310
that he personally captured

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.110
Jiang Qingyu?

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.350
Second,

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:45.030
Jiang Qingyu was involved

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.530
in the Hao family massacre.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:47.620
I'm a victim.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:49.620
How could you say I'm meddling?

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:52.090
Mr. Tang,

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.930
are you doubting my ability
to handle the case?

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.520
I have my own leads,

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:58.600
but one person's judgment alone

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.060
can't convince everyone.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:01.930
Then Sword King,

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.100
why not hold a public trial
for Jiang Qingyu?

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:07.440
Yes, a public trial.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.970
Yes, a public trial!

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:10.440
Since the Master of Wanqiao Chamber

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.770
is involved in the case,

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.200
a public trial is the only way
to convince everyone.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.440
Yes, bring Jiang Qingyu to trial!

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:14.920
Public trial!

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.920
Try him publicly!

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.070
That's right.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.870
Public trial!

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.720
Public trial!

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.160
Public trial!

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.350
Put Jiang Qingyu on public trial.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:21.640
You're all correct.

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:23.310
He should be

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.880
interrogated in front of

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.320
all martial artists.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.110
It seems

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.480
I've arrived at the perfect time.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.830
Those with purpose

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.170
always arrive at the right time.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.890
At the Qiongtai Banquet
the day after tomorrow,

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:41.830
I will publicly try Jiang Qingyu

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.410
and give the martial arts world

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:44.850
a satisfactory answer.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:47.640
Anyone in Sword King City
is welcome to attend.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.840
Let's try him together

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.830
and expose the mastermind behind him!

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.270
-Great!
-Great!

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.160
The Sword King is wise!

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.200
The Sword King is wise!

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.550
Mr. Tang,

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:02.830
do you dare to come?

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.170
If the Sword King dares,

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.130
why wouldn't I?

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:57.610
As a small punishment

00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.360
for arriving late,

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:01.880
my friend.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.040
The drizzle's just stopped.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.580
The monk is tired of the journey.

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.510
The Go game is like the game of stars.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.120
You always sought solitude.

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:43.750
I never thought

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.080
you'd be disturbed by worldly affairs

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.110
and go to Sword King City

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:49.710
for the Sword Duel Festival.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.090
I'm no man of the mundane world.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.770
With no attachments

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:55.720
or obstacles,

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.730
I come and go as I please.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:01.100
You've been pondering for a long time.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.860
Something's troubling you?

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.830
Three years ago,

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.840
we played our first game
at Wenqi Pavilion.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.600
Since then,

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.070
we've bonded through Go,

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:27.200
meeting once a year.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.640
Though I call you my friend,

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.100
I've never truly understood you.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.400
The path you seek

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.510
is the path of salvation.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:51.760
But tell meâ€”

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.420
is the one you're trying to save

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:55.960
truly

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:57.430
worth saving?

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.860
The six realms and three lives

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.320
all have their own karma.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.230
Those I encounter

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:05.430
are those I must save.

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:11.570
I simply do what I can to save others

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.110
with a clear conscience.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:14.449
It seems

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.630
you once made some choices

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.570
that trouble your conscience.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.409
Just making conversation.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:31.800
My friend,

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.260
don't take offense.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.760
You're right.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.330
If there is someone...

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.940
I am not listening to that.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:41.300
You only have two hours

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.130
to rest here.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.929
You came to play Go with me, didn't you?

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.030
Friend,

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.940
are you deliberately letting me win?

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.920
Then I'll accept your kindness.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:49.270
Every time we play,

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.650
you always use your power
to protect the flowers.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:53.850
I just wonder

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.340
how many people like you
exist in this world.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.020
I just hope

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.560
the one you never meant to harm

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:02.060
won't die

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.330
because of you.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.480
What the hell

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.740
is Fengliu Shop doing?

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.920
With your vast connections,

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.630
how could you not know

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.560
Tang Lici is
the Master of Wanqiao Chamber?

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.280
That brat

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.550
just seized
the Sword Phoenix's essence
just like that

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.950
and stole the spotlight!

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:01.360
Sword King, you rashly promised Tang Lici

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.960
a public trial,

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.120
and all you care about
is who stole the show.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.250
The Fengliu Shop is so eager
to control me.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.820
Sending Madam Bai wasn't enough?

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.990
Now they've sent you?

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.710
You only knew Tang Lici

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.370
went up the Tianyan Sword Wall

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.360
but didn't realize

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.230
he also sent Xue Xianzi

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:23.480
to test your limits.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.950
Have you truly not noticed

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:27.590
that your secretâ€”

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:28.760
using the divine pills
to improve your sword skillsâ€”

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.130
has already been exposed?

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:31.860
And instead of making amends,

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.140
you've walked right into his trap again.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.950
He's likely already seen through

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.750
every one of your foolish moves.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.320
Master is already on his way.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.450
If you still can't think of something,

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.120
then prepare to die.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:52.070
Sword King,

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:52.920
here is today's

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.150
guest registry.

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.590
[Puzhu, Tianjing Pavilion; Yin Sanxiao,
Dongfang Xu, Yinqi Alliance]

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.270
Tang Lici may be scheming,

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.720
but I'm not without a counter.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.730
The one to stand trial the day
after tomorrow won't be Jiang Qingyu.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:13.960
It will be Tang Lici.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:17.720
All I need is for your master

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.550
to lend me an expert in disguise.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.150
Master Puzhu, since you've been ordered

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:32.610
to investigate this case,

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:33.790
I'll speak plainly.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.760
When I interrogated Jiang Qingyu,

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.710
he wouldn't reveal

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:38.710
who was behind himâ€”

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:39.760
only that this person

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.690
held great power

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:42.760
and that revealing their identity

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.420
could doom his entire family.

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:48.590
Besides the imperial court,

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:49.850
who else could do that?

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.360
Second,

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:53.310
he said the Blood Ghost Pills

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.510
have already spread across the jianghu,

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:55.960
not just around Mount Tai.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.560
Who else but Wanqiao Chamber

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.540
can have a merchant network

00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:59.600
spanning the world

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.260
and also imperial backing

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.340
to sell the Evil Pills

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.900
everywhere?

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.690
You think Wanqiao Chamber

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.590
is secretly selling the Evil Pills?

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:08.360
Exactly.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.840
I'm afraid I've fallen into the trap

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.630
set by the emperor's uncle,

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.360
the Master of Wanqiao Chamber.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.860
He's been pressuring me nonstop,

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:18.660
trying to interfere
in Jiang Qingyu's trial.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.480
Sword King Yu,

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.290
you're trying to mislead me.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.580
I'm merely stating the facts.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:26.690
I only

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.030
look at evidence.

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.770
On the day of the public trial,

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.370
the evidence you want

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.510
will be revealed.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:34.630
No need to wait.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:36.280
I will

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:38.120
question Jiang Qingyu now.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:39.760
Now?

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.050
Some things

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.870
are best said
when fewer ears are listening.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:44.770
After all,

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.260
aside from Tang Lici,

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.550
the other person

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:49.680
with such reach and resources

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.880
is you, Sword King Yu.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.810
The innocent have nothing to fear.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.100
Sir, please follow me.

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:14.510
Please come in.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.610
The treasure ship of Wanqiao Chamber

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.670
is truly luxurious and magnificent.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.930
If you get oil stains on my clothes,

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.240
you'll wash them yourself as always.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.550
Miss Zhong.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.000
Miss Shei.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.720
You've also come to Sword King City.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.450
I almost didn't recognize you.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:56.690
Right?

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.000
Shei looks prettier now, right?

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.620
I must thank you, Miss Zhong,

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.210
for saving me back in Yanxian.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:03.290
Seeing you well now

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.040
puts my heart at ease.

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:06.230
Mr. Gu,

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.680
don't stand on ceremony.

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:10.700
This is Chi Yun, the Cloud.

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:11.890
This is Miss Shei.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:12.760
This is

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.510
Mr. Gu from the Sword Alliance.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:16.560
Nice to meet you.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:17.280
So,

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:18.960
you're also here

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.690
for that so-called Sword King?

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.230
Yes.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:22.840
But Master Puzhu

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.970
has already gone to meet Sword King Yu.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.210
Please.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:00.850
This way.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.420
What's happening?

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:20.080
Shen Langhun,

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:20.850
it's you!

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:22.710
How dare you come here

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:23.910
to kill the criminal?

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:28.560
Put out the fire!

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.420
Protect Sword King Yu!

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:31.240
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:06.410
Why hasn't Shen come back yet?

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:09.880
The fire's already out.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.160
Has something happened to him?

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:17.680
It was

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:19.360
a trap there.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:22.250
As expected.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:23.830
Did anyone see you?

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:24.360
No.
