WEBVTT

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.769
I haven't talked to anyone, really…

00:00:01.853 --> 00:00:02.840
Now that we've decided,

00:00:02.923 --> 00:00:04.030
should I write down our names?

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.690
You're in a group with the "Big Four"?

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.360
A bunch of strangers, basically…

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.860
My contact lens fell out.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.780
You can't see well without your glasses,
can you, Hioki?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.500
Whoa!

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.770
I'm so-sorry…

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.330
I'll do anything. Please, just forgive me.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.709
I'll think about it.

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.590
I'll give you my answer before the trip is
over.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.360
Yeah, what's up?

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.950
Well, it's just that with your glasses on,

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:38.890
you have a totally different vibe.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.040
I do?

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.740
He means you look cute.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.280
Yeah, you're cute.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.860
Huh?

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:48.890
Oh…

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.330
Yeah.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.570
There's no way you actually mean that.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.520
It's okay. You don't have to force it.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.300
No, I'm serious. You're cute, Hioki.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.870
Huh?

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.300
You're cute.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.540
Hey, um…

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.170
Sorry to break up the lovefest,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.030
but isn't it time for a bath?

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.290
Speaking of which, Hioki,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.840
are you going to be okay in the bath?

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.680
Huh?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.040
Hey, listen.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.870
You're gonna take them off when you get
in, right?

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.500
Your glasses.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.820
Oh.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.100
"School Trip Joined a Group I'm Not Close to"

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.090
(Episode 2)
I totally forgot about the whole bath situation.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.970
It's not like being at home.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.570
But I'm sure it'll work out.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.070
I've got some juicy gossip.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.680
Someone saw you…

00:02:48.763 --> 00:02:49.640
What…

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.950
- Hioki-chan.
- Tsujitani…

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.780
Oh, sorry. You guys go on ahead.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.980
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.320
We're gonna head in, too.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.850
Later, later.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.470
Oh.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.150
So, I heard…

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.450
I heard you held hands with Watarai?

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.680
No! There was a reason for that…

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.830
That's so not fair! You're all over
the Big Four's Instagram, too.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.000
Man, at this rate,

00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:20.760
- Hioki's becoming one of the popular kids!
- Hey! Listen to me!

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.120
- Can't hear you!
- Yes, you can!

00:03:22.144 --> 00:03:22.896
Can't hear you!

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.450
You can totally hear me!
You're just messing with me, aren't you?

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:24.640
So what happened?

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.400
So?

00:03:25.483 --> 00:03:26.660
So, so?

00:03:26.743 --> 00:03:28.170
What are you talking about?

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.460
Was there a confession of love or
something?

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:30.030
No way.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.670
- We're going in ahead of you.
- Okay.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.950
Sorry about that.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.440
What were you guys talking about?

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.000
Huh?

00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:45.670
Oh.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.350
It wasn't anything really.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.020
Oh, okay.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.640
Anyway,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.760
Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.190
Want to go in together?

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.400
No, I'm fine.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.760
I'm seriously fine.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.100
If you say so.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.750
Try not to fall again.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.190
I'll be careful.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.530
Sigh.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.700
I can't bring myself to tell him.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.980
Alright.

00:04:34.063 --> 00:04:35.200
Finally… I made it.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.440
Whoa.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.480
Ah.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.010
Someone… Can someone turn it off?

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.270
- What are you doing?
- Can someone turn it off…?

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.980
You saved me.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.070
Is that…

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.470
Watarai?

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.370
Thank you.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.850
Wait for me after you're done.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.240
Huh?

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.860
It would be a pain if you actually fell.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.560
Be careful.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.060
Okay, I'm letting go.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.950
Yeah.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.310
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.250
Those two are getting along great.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.860
They're like a couple of kindergarden kids.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.230
By the way, Hioki,
what do you do during swimming lessons?

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.580
I don't really go swimming.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.980
My vision was better in middle school.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.120
Besides, our high school doesn't have a pool.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.910
Oh.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.100
What about the beach?

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.270
The beach?

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.910
Even if I go, I don't actually get in the water.

00:05:44.993 --> 00:05:46.310
So it's never been a problem.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.180
The beach, huh.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.580
The beach is awesome.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.910
Man, I wanna go.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.120
- Man, I really wanna go.
- Then why don't we?

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.230
Huh?

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.420
- Summer break's coming up, right?
- For real?

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.730
Huh?

00:05:59.813 --> 00:06:01.480
- Hey, let's go, let's go!
- That's a great idea.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.010
Let's all go together!

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.270
Then Hioki…

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.560
you're in charge of the fireworks.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.450
OK.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.740
I'm…

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.340
…included in this?

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.870
- Are you awake?
- Yeah.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.210
Let's talk.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.860
Okay.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.680
About what?

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.130
Do you even have to ask?

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.210
When you're on a school trip,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.580
you obviously talk about romance.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.140
Yeah, let's do it.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.570
Let's talk.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.140
I'm curious about your love life, Hioki.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.050
Huh? Mine?!

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.410
Hey, Hioki, do you have a girlfriend?

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.750
Uh.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.850
No.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.980
I don't.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.270
Aww, man.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.710
Really?

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.120
Huh?

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.160
But didn't you have one in middle school?

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.450
You know,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.140
the one you were always with.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.630
Oh.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:15.950
No.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.080
That was a misunderstanding.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.080
I was just helping a friend through a
tough time.

00:07:20.163 --> 00:07:22.020
People just assumed we were dating.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.150
And then the rumor just took off.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.450
Oh, so that's what happened.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.160
Aww, that's a bummer.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.170
I really wanted to hear one of your
romance stories, Hioki.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.130
Sorry, I don't have any good material for
you.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:37.920
So, in other words,

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.040
everyone in this room right now

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.830
is single.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.240
Huh?

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.420
Really?

00:07:44.503 --> 00:07:45.420
That's kind of surprising.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.090
I just

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.110
got out of a relationship, too.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.540
Me too.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.810
Actually, I'm taking a break from dating
for a while.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.960
Well, yeah, of course.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.330
After breaking up the way you did.

00:07:58.413 --> 00:07:59.830
Yikes.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400
Yeah.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.750
Nakasato's girlfriend,

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.528
they grew up together and were dating,

00:08:06.817 --> 00:08:08.020
but she got stolen away from me.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.000
By her college-aged tutor.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.840
Wow.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.860
That's way more dramatic than I expected.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.620
But compared to me,

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.080
Morisaki had it way worse, didn't he?

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.660
True. Morisaki's ex was,

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.230
what's the word…

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.020
- Super possessive.
- Totally.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.510
Ugh, I don't even want to think about it.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.330
Please, just drop it.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.020
It's past lights out. Go to sleep.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:37.950
Oh, Suzuki-kun.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.560
I don't know,

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.600
it seems like being a hot guy is tough,
too.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.950
Anyway, is this what talking about romance

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.350
on a school trip is supposed to feel like?

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.460
Alright, good night.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.280
But,

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.760
speaking of intense people,

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.520
- Watarai's pretty intense, too.
- He is.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.480
No, I'm not.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.910
We're not talking about your ex.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.260
We mean you, Watarai.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.540
It's not just intense,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.500
you're also super jealous.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.030
Once you fall for someone,

00:09:15.113 --> 00:09:16.880
you're the type to get way too invested,
right?

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.220
That's an exaggeration.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.850
Oh, but according to his ex,

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.590
she said it was actually really
suffocating.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.310
Oh.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.400
And also,

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:28.310
she said you lead people on without
meaning to.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.360
That's the review from a teenage girl.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.400
Hey.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.160
Don't talk about it like you're reviewing
a product.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.230
Oh, by the way…

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.430
Don't give Hioki any weird ideas.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:39.650
Yeah.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.300
There's still a lot more.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.470
And another one…

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.840
- That's enough.
- Seriously?

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.560
- Yeah, stop.
- Oh, crap…

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.700
Whoa, I got it, I got it.

00:09:55.783 --> 00:09:58.500
It's three against one again.
Hioki, come on.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.240
Go, go, throw it!

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.200
Okay.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.400
Whoa.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:12.590
The sun's coming up.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.600
It's so beautiful.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.170
It really is.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.830
Such a beautiful sunrise.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:27.870
You know,

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.470
I really like the morning sun.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.660
I don't get it.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.950
Yeah, more than the sunset.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.790
I'm a morning sun person too.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.440
Oh.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.030
Hioki, you're up?

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.380
Ah, yeah.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.370
What's wrong?

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.120
Don't tell me you're not feeling well.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.940
No.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.720
It's not that.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.530
Are you okay?

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.220
You can take your time.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.520
Just try telling us.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.950
Well…

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.150
Um…

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.670
My name…

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.130
is also "Asahi."

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.520
Ah.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.930
You don't mean…

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.260
The morning sun…

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.560
Asahi.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.190
Huh, is that it?

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.410
That's it?

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.170
Ah.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.490
Sorry.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:37.850
That's so cute!

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:43.840
I thought you'd think I was weird…

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.990
I was so worried.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.300
Geez. Ah.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.850
That's great.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.320
Let's take a picture.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.290
- Hurry up, let's take one.
- The lighting is perfect right now.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.140
It'll definitely look good.

00:11:58.223 --> 00:12:00.060
- Yeah, yeah, totally.
- Here, look.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.420
Hioki, you too.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:02.490
Oh, okay.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.690
- Hioki, hurry, get in the middle.
- Wait.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.620
- Over here, over here.
- Okay, okay. 3, 2, 1.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:14.710
It turned out pretty good, right?

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.420
Yeah, it's cute. Looks great, cute.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.290
Ah, it's backwards, it's backwards.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:23.880
This is awesome.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.310
Okay, students going to the amusement
park, please gather over here.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.310
The second day of the school trip.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.150
The main event of the day was free time.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.280
Our group was going to the amusement park.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:38.970
Should I bring tissues?

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.370
Um, I'm sure you all know,

00:12:44.453 --> 00:12:46.050
but once we get there,

00:12:46.133 --> 00:12:48.370
the boys and girls must stick together.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.030
Yes.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:59.128
Is hanging out with girls that bad?

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.470
But after hearing those love stories last
night,

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.810
I can't say I blame you.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.960
What should we do?

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.100
Why don't we all just ditch?

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.680
Ditch and go where?

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:13.920
You know, I was thinking.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.270
Do we really have to stay together the
whole time?

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.320
- Huh?
- No.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:19.990
I mean, the teachers

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.350
can't possibly be watching us the whole
time.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.320
Why don't we decide on a meeting spot

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.230
and then split?

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:29.730
That's it!

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.460
Great idea. You're a genius.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.540
Today's going to be so much fun then.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:40.990
Hey, we can't do that.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:42.730
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.000
Because we could just split up

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.620
and meet up again later, right?

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.140
No, that's against the rules.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.270
- But…
- But the teachers will be patrolling.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.810
Wouldn't it be terrible if we got caught?

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:58.200
Besides, I heard some upperclassmen last
year got suspended for breaking the rules.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.510
That's right.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.360
So,

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.640
let's all stick together.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.670
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:09.830
In the end,

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.370
the girls' persistence won out.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.220
Let me see, let me see, let me see.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.240
What do you think?

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:17.920
So cute.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.070
Then again,

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.800
everyone complained,

00:14:22.883 --> 00:14:24.740
but they were actually having a lot of
fun.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.490
Hioki, you should pick one too.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.620
From these?

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.300
Oh, I pick these for you.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.540
Okay.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.210
So cute.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:44.730
Thanks…

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.920
Then I'll get this one.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.360
- This one's pretty cute.
- How is it?

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.920
Yeah.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.290
It suits you.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.010
Is it cute?

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.330
- I see.
- Yeah.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.230
Thanks.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.570
Sorry for the wait, everyone.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.980
Here, please get on.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.430
- It's here, it's here!
- Whoa, this is awesome.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Ah.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.060
Ah, this…

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.440
- Watarai-kun…
- Hioki, let's sit together.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.120
Okay.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.220
The doors are closing.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.460
Thank you.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.660
Don't tell me…

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.980
Are you not good with these kinds of
rides?

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.840
Oh, no, I can handle this.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.620
But I can't do intense ones like roller
coasters.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:40.430
I see.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:42.490
If you feel like you can't take it,

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.760
let me know.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.060
Okay. Thank you.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.160
Yeah.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.080
- All right.
- The ride is starting.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.160
Whoa, whoa.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.530
Nakasato, I'll take a picture for you.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.140
- It looks good on you.
- Thanks.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.270
Hioki, you've got some ketchup on you.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:35.610
Hm?

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.610
The other side.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600
Sorry.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.800
Thanks.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.560
Hey, Hioki-kun.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.260
What are you to Watarai-kun?

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.960
Huh? Nothing at all…

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.330
But you two suddenly got so close, didn't
you?

00:17:06.413 --> 00:17:08.410
You barely even talked before the school
trip.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:09.230
Why?

00:17:09.313 --> 00:17:10.550
Hey, Hioki-kun.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.760
Just who exactly are you?

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.620
- I'm nothing special…
- And yesterday…

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.510
I heard you guys held hands.

00:17:16.534 --> 00:17:17.236
That was just…

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.160
- Seriously? I'm so jealous.
- Right?

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.310
Hey, how did you two get so close?

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.310
How…? I didn't really do anything…

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.480
Please.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.070
We really want to get on good terms with
the Four Heavenly Kings.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.910
By the way, Watarai-kun…

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.620
Is he that friendly with everyone?

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.980
What about Morisaki-kun?

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.400
Does he have a girlfriend right now?

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.230
And Nakasato-kun?

00:17:36.313 --> 00:17:37.520
Do you know what his type is?

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.620
Tell us.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.080
Um…

00:17:41.163 --> 00:17:42.080
I…

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.370
What's wrong?

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.520
It's fine. It's nothing.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.900
Right?

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.250
Let's go.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.120
Did something happen?

00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:59.710
It's nothing.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.010
I see.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.780
30-minute wait from this point.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.080
The line is huge.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.750
It says it's a 30-minute wait.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800
Hioki.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.290
Are you sure you'll be okay by yourself?

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.560
Yeah, I'm totally fine.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.270
I'm used to being alone.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.840
Sorry about this. Later, we can all go on

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.110
the merry-go-round together.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.150
-No, no, we don't have to
ride the merry-go-round.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.990
Well then…

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.820
Hit us up if you need anything.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:33.810
Take care.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.140
Let's go.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.730
Let's go, let's go.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.050
What should I do now?

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.310
If there is space ahead of you,
please move forward.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.640
Hey, I have a suggestion.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.120
After we're done with this,

00:19:09.203 --> 00:19:11.400
what if the seven of us
go on another ride together?

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.880
But…

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.540
Hioki is waiting for us.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.260
But,

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.360
-Hioki-kun can't handle thrill rides, right?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.340
He's going to be waiting anyway,

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.690
so I don't think it makes a difference.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.500
In that case, we should just go on rides
Hioki can handle.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.220
Didn't Hioki-kun say it himself?

00:19:26.303 --> 00:19:27.500
He's used to being alone.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.360
He's always alone at school anyway.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.760
It should be fine, right?

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.290
No.

00:19:32.373 --> 00:19:33.390
Of course it's not fine.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.220
We can't do that.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:41.970
Besides, look.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:42.650
If we do that,

00:19:42.733 --> 00:19:45.060
then Hioki would be the only one on his
own.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.710
According to the rules,

00:19:46.793 --> 00:19:47.910
that's not allowed, is it?

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.710
Well…

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.700
I mean, yeah, but…

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.140
If you girls don't want to go that badly,

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.830
why don't you just go on your own?

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.750
Oh, no, that's not it.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.570
We were just…

00:19:59.653 --> 00:20:01.140
Anyway, once this is over,

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.730
I'm only sticking with Hioki.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.990
By the way,

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.070
why are you so protective of Hioki-kun?

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.880
You guys weren't even that close at the
beginning.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.780
Watarai-kun,

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:27.610
about Hioki-kun…

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.150
What do you even see in him?

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.960
Well… How should I put this?

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.110
So what is Hioki-kun to you, Watarai-kun?

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.880
That's true.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.670
Now that you mention it…

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:04.650
In that case…

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.230
I'll sit next to Hioki.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.010
From the very beginning,

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.420
he's been so considerate of me.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.880
Watarai…

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.560
What does he…

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.620
like about me?

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.430
What am I even thinking?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.200
We should get going.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.220
Huh?

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:46.500
That was so fun.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:50.810
Huh?

00:21:50.893 --> 00:21:52.010
Where's Hioki?

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.300
What?

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.520
Did he go to the restroom?

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.320
Did he text anyone?

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.350
- No.
- I'll call him.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.230
I'm calling him now.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.320
But he's not picking up.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.080
What?

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.680
Wait, seriously? Where did he go?

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:09.090
Don't tell me…

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.270
he's lost.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.330
We'll be in deep trouble if the teachers
find out.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:17.810
I'll try calling too.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.540
Where are you? Mommy, where are you?

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.780
Mommy…

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.610
Is there anywhere we haven't looked?

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.260
Hioki.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.280
(Next Episode)
Hioki.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.720
(Hioki Is Missing)
Where are you…

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.100
Why is Watarai…

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.400
so nice to me?

00:22:45.401 --> 00:22:46.605
(Love Accelerates in the Haunted House?!)

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:47.630
If you get scared,

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.000
you can hold my hand.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.640
Good night.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:54.570
Good night.
