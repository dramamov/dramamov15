WALKING ON THIN ICE

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:44.105
DRUG USE ISN’T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

00:00:44.147 --> 00:00:45.453
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:47.104
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.486
I wish a bag of cash
fell from the sky.

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:53.814
PREVIOUSLY...

00:00:54.057 --> 00:00:55.853
Where did this come from?

00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:58.443
- ...earned over 200 million won a month.
- 200 million?

00:00:58.462 --> 00:01:00.712
I can do anything for my family.

00:01:00.986 --> 00:01:01.986
No!

00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:05.568
We're not losing the house.
And you're not dying.

00:01:05.626 --> 00:01:06.598
Let's work together.

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:09.284
Let's be partners.
You and me.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.188
There are countless dealers,
but there's no one safer than him.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.564
100 million in two weeks.

00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:18.104
Make it happen,
and we'll talk again.

00:01:18.104 --> 00:01:19.104
Fine by me.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.689
So, how was your first day?

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.762
I said, give me my money!

00:01:38.104 --> 00:01:39.981
When I make 200 million,
I'm quitting.

00:01:43.926 --> 00:01:45.300
How about we keep going?

00:01:46.104 --> 00:01:48.731
Yeah, okay.

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:50.926
Someone's dead.

00:01:56.023 --> 00:02:00.568
Did you think we'd just earn
easy money and live happily ever after?

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:07.041
Don't kid yourself!

00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:09.029
You're still a criminal!

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.688
James is the bad guy,

00:02:12.994 --> 00:02:14.077
and not you, right?

00:02:15.248 --> 00:02:17.080
I can't do this anymore.

00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:21.480
I suddenly thought to myself.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.970
Comparing now and
before all this started...

00:02:24.762 --> 00:02:27.512
Which one's worse off?

00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:30.188
You're desperate for money,
aren't you?

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:37.772
If you're not going to bury me now,
let the fuck go of me.

00:02:41.464 --> 00:02:43.233
Everything you love

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:46.605
and everything you wish to protect

00:02:48.963 --> 00:02:50.963
will all be smashed by me.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.480
Let's erase him.

00:03:00.204 --> 00:03:01.430
For good.

00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:07.772
EPISODE 11

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.064
HANSEL AND GRETEL

00:03:24.278 --> 00:03:25.762
Eunsoo.

00:03:26.668 --> 00:03:27.926
Ta-da!

00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:36.328
Do you like it?

00:03:39.314 --> 00:03:41.147
Are we moving

00:03:41.772 --> 00:03:44.441
because you lent money to a friend?

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.064
When is Mom coming back?

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.355
Eunsoo.

00:03:53.647 --> 00:03:58.104
You mustn't be poor at heart
even without money.

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:01.297
What's a poor heart?

00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:07.987
Not sharing, taking others' things,
and hurting people.

00:04:08.104 --> 00:04:11.987
Then do the landlady, my classmate,

00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.104
and Daddy's friend
all have poor hearts?

00:04:18.668 --> 00:04:20.490
I don't like them.

00:04:22.023 --> 00:04:25.271
So people with poor hearts are bad?

00:04:26.355 --> 00:04:29.790
Yeah, that's right.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.228
So, don't be like them.

00:04:33.522 --> 00:04:35.897
Even if someone hurts you,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.856
don't hurt them back.
Can you promise?

00:04:43.075 --> 00:04:47.856
GRETEL PUSHED THE WITCH WITH FORCE
AND SLAMMED THE OVEN DOOR SHUT

00:04:50.386 --> 00:04:51.595
Promise.

00:07:35.856 --> 00:07:38.314
Huh? What?

00:07:38.701 --> 00:07:40.625
Doctor! Doctor!

00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:42.939
Doctor!

00:07:57.104 --> 00:07:59.551
Fortunately, nothing's broken.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.104
Did you tuck-and-roll or something?

00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:11.522
How did I end up here?

00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:13.731
Someone texted 911.

00:08:13.772 --> 00:08:17.474
Thank God.
You'd have been dead otherwise.

00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:20.435
Our team should go see a shaman.

00:08:20.605 --> 00:08:24.023
Why so many misfortunes this year?

00:08:25.892 --> 00:08:30.142
So, what got you there
alone that night?

00:08:34.897 --> 00:08:40.012
A source tipped me off,
but I got jumped on the spot.

00:08:40.767 --> 00:08:42.614
Oh, a source...

00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:44.598
Who was the source?

00:08:45.731 --> 00:08:46.772
You don't know him.

00:08:48.688 --> 00:08:50.961
You'll have to tell us
during questioning.

00:08:51.045 --> 00:08:52.378
You even fired your gun.

00:08:52.568 --> 00:08:55.687
- Did you get the security footage?
- Yes.

00:08:55.945 --> 00:08:59.104
But there were barely lights.
It was too dark to see.

00:09:00.229 --> 00:09:03.225
We got one clip and
sent it for analysis.

00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.569
But nothing useful yet.

00:09:05.939 --> 00:09:08.731
DONGBU MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL

00:09:11.182 --> 00:09:13.492
- How long have I been here?
- Two days.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.155
What?

00:09:30.064 --> 00:09:32.104
DRUG CRIMES UNIT

00:09:33.647 --> 00:09:34.781
Where's my phone?

00:09:35.439 --> 00:09:36.320
We couldn't find it.

00:09:36.902 --> 00:09:37.866
And the car?

00:09:42.605 --> 00:09:44.307
- Huh?
- My car!

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.053
Hold on.

00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:49.605
Yeah.

00:09:51.563 --> 00:09:52.522
Who came?

00:09:52.981 --> 00:09:53.939
Hey, what's going on?

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.314
It's the man who saved the girl
from Hwang Junhyun.

00:09:59.816 --> 00:10:00.691
What about him?

00:10:04.897 --> 00:10:06.230
He's at the station now.

00:10:07.219 --> 00:10:08.423
To make a statement.

00:10:14.064 --> 00:10:18.439
GWANGNAM POLICE STATION

00:10:18.579 --> 00:10:20.832
​Sir, you can't
discharge yourself like this.

00:10:20.897 --> 00:10:22.970
Let Eunyoung and me handle it.

00:10:23.104 --> 00:10:25.104
Don't take your concussion lightly.

00:10:25.355 --> 00:10:27.559
You need to recover a bit more.

00:10:29.817 --> 00:10:31.497
- Inspector?
- Sir?

00:10:40.922 --> 00:10:42.461
Isn't he still recovering?

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:44.839
Whatever. Get to work.

00:11:03.772 --> 00:11:05.226
Glad you're safe.

00:11:05.976 --> 00:11:07.218
Crazy bastard.

00:11:07.851 --> 00:11:10.105
You're dying to go to jail, huh?

00:11:11.689 --> 00:11:14.331
- Should I lock you up?
- Yes.

00:11:17.856 --> 00:11:19.023
I'll turn myself in.

00:11:23.772 --> 00:11:26.147
TWO DAYS AGO

00:11:39.926 --> 00:11:40.970
Are you okay?

00:11:48.897 --> 00:11:51.064
What about you?
Are you hurt?

00:12:00.981 --> 00:12:02.272
Let's run.

00:12:03.314 --> 00:12:07.397
We can't survive here
as long as that man's alive.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.439
I still have things to do.

00:12:17.104 --> 00:12:19.314
I'm not planning to run forever.

00:12:22.355 --> 00:12:26.398
Snap out of it.
Is revenge more important than your life?

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.500
Yes!

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:32.160
That's right!

00:12:32.584 --> 00:12:36.251
Since that day,
I haven't felt alive one bit.

00:12:37.472 --> 00:12:38.772
Wanna know the truth?

00:12:40.283 --> 00:12:43.480
I can't move on
because it still haunts me.

00:12:44.574 --> 00:12:47.449
I lost everything
that was precious to me!

00:12:53.104 --> 00:12:57.104
I'm not running.

00:13:00.814 --> 00:13:02.188
No, don't!

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.290
You came this far
to prove you didn't kill.

00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:09.292
You can't become a murderer now!

00:13:10.064 --> 00:13:12.065
You were about to kill him yourself.

00:13:12.329 --> 00:13:15.738
No, I was trying to save you.

00:13:17.034 --> 00:13:19.661
Like you said,
he's still a cop.

00:13:19.772 --> 00:13:21.564
People will find him.

00:13:22.496 --> 00:13:24.104
If we let him live,

00:13:25.926 --> 00:13:27.633
our families will die.

00:13:28.439 --> 00:13:30.226
If that bastard doesn't die,

00:13:31.939 --> 00:13:33.397
this will never end.

00:14:00.981 --> 00:14:02.522
Damn it.

00:14:11.522 --> 00:14:12.522
Just...

00:14:18.763 --> 00:14:19.935
Turn yourself in.

00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:29.056
You won't leave me alone,
and I have nowhere to run.

00:14:29.533 --> 00:14:32.064
Might as well confess
and lessen my sentence.

00:14:33.348 --> 00:14:38.817
Who knows? Maybe they'll show mercy
if I confess everything.

00:14:40.192 --> 00:14:41.522
Confess everything?

00:14:41.564 --> 00:14:42.919
About that night's accident.

00:14:44.272 --> 00:14:48.439
Why you were there,
and who you were with...

00:14:48.772 --> 00:14:53.547
I guess I'll have to start
by explaining our relationship.

00:14:54.856 --> 00:14:56.605
Where should I begin?

00:14:57.178 --> 00:15:00.136
How about when you
sent me threat texts?

00:15:01.663 --> 00:15:06.064
Or maybe with
Hwang Donghyun's death.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.474
Are you threatening me?

00:15:28.981 --> 00:15:30.821
I didn't know it would work.

00:15:32.104 --> 00:15:34.704
I finally understand how you felt.

00:15:36.431 --> 00:15:40.104
I'm seriously liking
your face right now too.

00:15:41.104 --> 00:15:44.403
I really like the look in your eyes.

00:15:44.465 --> 00:15:49.104
I feel a sense of achievement
and satisfaction, you know?

00:15:49.981 --> 00:15:51.897
I could look at it all day.

00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:03.754
Did they know each other before?

00:16:09.104 --> 00:16:10.856
Don't flatter yourself.

00:16:11.897 --> 00:16:14.105
Who'd believe a criminal like you?

00:16:17.104 --> 00:16:18.605
I suppose so.

00:16:23.731 --> 00:16:25.104
If it were only my words.

00:16:30.018 --> 00:16:32.605
After a long investigation,

00:16:32.647 --> 00:16:35.104
I was going to catch you
red-handed on the scene.

00:16:35.104 --> 00:16:37.689
But you attacked me,
and I defended myself.

00:16:37.731 --> 00:16:38.755
You look like shit.

00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:43.023
If you'd listened,
and paid me 200 million every week,

00:16:43.064 --> 00:16:44.856
you would've kept your life.

00:16:44.897 --> 00:16:47.105
Cleaning this up
is a pain for me too.

00:16:49.147 --> 00:16:53.689
This will help me get
a few believers, don't you think?

00:16:58.578 --> 00:17:02.104
You know, when this all surfaces,

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.782
you'll have to give up on your son.

00:17:05.422 --> 00:17:07.255
Might never see him again.

00:17:09.254 --> 00:17:14.871
You may not know, but we know you
just as well as you know us.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.118
Turn myself in?

00:17:20.423 --> 00:17:22.000
Are you kidding me?

00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:25.291
That's basically suicide.

00:17:25.856 --> 00:17:27.105
Not always.

00:17:28.555 --> 00:17:29.932
You said it yourself.

00:17:29.985 --> 00:17:32.815
If you grab someone's weakness,
it can become your own.

00:17:33.415 --> 00:17:34.916
You think Jang Taegu's any different?

00:17:36.402 --> 00:17:38.471
We just have to pretend.

00:17:39.823 --> 00:17:42.935
Jang Taegu will never
let us turn ourselves in.

00:17:48.939 --> 00:17:51.105
You probably know it best.

00:17:51.678 --> 00:17:55.556
Who's going to lose the most
if I confess everything?

00:18:01.444 --> 00:18:03.277
Ready to negotiate now?

00:18:23.281 --> 00:18:24.961
- What?
- Didn't you hear me?

00:18:26.023 --> 00:18:27.439
Drop the Park Sua case.

00:18:28.238 --> 00:18:29.105
But...

00:18:29.147 --> 00:18:30.809
She said she didn't know.

00:18:31.105 --> 00:18:33.723
Besides, the other girl started it.

00:18:34.104 --> 00:18:36.019
She'll only get a
level-one juvenile ruling.

00:18:36.051 --> 00:18:37.843
Don't waste your energy on it.

00:18:37.994 --> 00:18:40.495
Then why'd you tell me to tail her?

00:18:41.104 --> 00:18:43.856
You said she might be tied
to the drug gang, and so...

00:18:43.897 --> 00:18:47.023
Don't make me repeat myself.
Get out.

00:19:02.577 --> 00:19:03.480
What?

00:19:03.522 --> 00:19:05.104
I don't know.

00:19:05.647 --> 00:19:07.564
I don't know what went on in there,

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.605
but I just got ordered
to drop the Park Sua case.

00:19:22.397 --> 00:19:24.731
Fortunately, you didn't get infected.

00:19:25.104 --> 00:19:27.605
But how did you even
get hurt like this?

00:19:30.104 --> 00:19:33.605
Well, I just fell.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.147
Oh! Hello, there.

00:22:00.647 --> 00:22:03.702
I'll return all the Vaka
that you retrieved...

00:22:03.804 --> 00:22:07.814
...from Kang Hwirim.
And we'll call it even.

00:22:07.856 --> 00:22:09.981
You're offering me my own stuff?

00:22:10.731 --> 00:22:13.846
If it were left in your car,
they'd have seized it already.

00:22:14.188 --> 00:22:16.104
And you'd be under investigation.

00:22:16.104 --> 00:22:18.188
Shouldn't you thank me?

00:22:18.689 --> 00:22:20.605
Is this why you saved me?

00:22:21.401 --> 00:22:26.104
Life for half the drug.
I think that's fair.

00:22:31.564 --> 00:22:34.605
Let's end our beef here.

00:22:36.064 --> 00:22:37.689
Don't bother us again.

00:22:39.325 --> 00:22:44.772
You're lucky to have survived.
Hang onto it.

00:22:49.734 --> 00:22:51.230
Make sure to clean things up.

00:22:52.439 --> 00:22:54.397
I'm sure you'll do great.

00:23:00.023 --> 00:23:01.397
How dare you...

00:23:10.104 --> 00:23:12.147
OSAKA CANCER TREATMENT CENTER

WHAT IS CARBON-ION THERAPY?

00:23:25.355 --> 00:23:27.355

RESERVATION COMPLETE

00:25:12.268 --> 00:25:13.596
I'm sorry, Father.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.932
I couldn't live the way you told me to.

00:25:19.939 --> 00:25:21.105
I'm sorry.

00:25:21.605 --> 00:25:23.605
But once I'm there,

00:25:25.981 --> 00:25:30.439
I'll try my best
to live as you said.

00:26:00.939 --> 00:26:03.188
KANG HWIRIM (MALE, 29)

00:26:04.939 --> 00:26:06.647
DECEMBER 8
TWON HOLDINGS IR - D DAY

00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:20.981
It went as we planned.

00:26:21.439 --> 00:26:25.023
Sua is in the clear,
and we split the drug fifty-fifty.

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.156
He can't touch us anymore.

00:26:29.255 --> 00:26:32.985
You should've seen
Jang Taegu's face.

00:26:33.443 --> 00:26:35.193
It felt so good.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.981
Yeah, I wish I'd seen it.

00:26:44.934 --> 00:26:47.272
I'll deliver the drug myself.

00:26:47.314 --> 00:26:49.355
You hold onto them until then.

00:26:52.821 --> 00:26:54.654
When will you be back from Japan?

00:27:01.695 --> 00:27:03.731
We made a promise at the start.

00:27:04.094 --> 00:27:06.159
I only need 200 million won.

00:27:11.894 --> 00:27:14.564
The money we didn't send
to Jang Taegu is my cut.

00:27:14.605 --> 00:27:17.147
The one billion from
Kang Hwirim is yours.

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:22.447
The day after tomorrow
is your D-day, right?

00:28:08.647 --> 00:28:10.104
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

00:28:11.272 --> 00:28:12.522

THIS IS THE REPORT ON
THE LEE KYUNG INCIDENT

00:28:36.104 --> 00:28:37.689
NAME: LEE KYUNG

00:28:40.104 --> 00:28:42.897
SENTENCED TO SEOUL
JUVENILE PRISON FOR 2 YEARS

00:29:02.104 --> 00:29:06.439
YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO GOLD ART GALLERY.

00:29:09.684 --> 00:29:11.897
GOLD ART GALLERY?

00:29:26.981 --> 00:29:28.355
SHAREHOLDER REGISTER

00:29:28.397 --> 00:29:30.147
GOLD ART GALLERY

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.064
Those bastards!

00:29:54.147 --> 00:29:56.064
THE SPEED-DELIVERY
YOU REQUESTED IS COMPLETE

00:30:03.216 --> 00:30:04.272
Mingyo!

00:30:06.939 --> 00:30:10.188
We'll see you later, bye.

00:30:19.647 --> 00:30:23.605
Oh, um... Daddy fell.

00:30:23.647 --> 00:30:25.653
Mom will be here soon.

00:30:28.312 --> 00:30:31.939
I just came to give you this.
I couldn't last time.

00:30:33.104 --> 00:30:35.594
Daddy can give you things
like this every day.

00:30:36.687 --> 00:30:38.147
And fill your room with them.

00:30:46.173 --> 00:30:47.150
Mingyo.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:52.480
How about not going to the US
and living with Daddy?

00:30:59.939 --> 00:31:00.932
Come here.

00:31:37.522 --> 00:31:40.921
Jang Taegu seemed urgent for cash.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.564
That means he cashed out his bitcoin.

00:31:44.104 --> 00:31:47.104
I even checked his relatives' accounts,
but found nothing.

00:31:48.252 --> 00:31:51.980
Where did all that cash go?

00:31:56.731 --> 00:32:01.452
Keep looking.
I believe you're different from him.

00:32:18.314 --> 00:32:20.230
Phantom appeared five years ago,

00:32:20.493 --> 00:32:22.522
and was on our radar for three years.

00:32:22.939 --> 00:32:25.064
Did Taegu collude from the start?

00:32:25.605 --> 00:32:27.105
At least 50 million per job.

00:32:27.814 --> 00:32:33.023
If he took kickbacks for three years,
where did all that cash go?

00:32:38.064 --> 00:32:39.104
Money...

00:32:40.467 --> 00:32:42.795
If I were him,
where would I stash it?

00:32:53.064 --> 00:32:54.856
Are you really leaving like this?

00:33:01.013 --> 00:33:02.959
Even after what Eunsoo did?

00:33:03.605 --> 00:33:06.147
If you can't stop,
then I'll make you stop.

00:33:06.188 --> 00:33:08.147
No!

00:33:10.647 --> 00:33:12.939
I told you it'll be over soon.

00:33:16.355 --> 00:33:18.272
She hurt you
and made you like this.

00:33:20.605 --> 00:33:22.188
Aren't you angry at Eunsoo?

00:33:22.653 --> 00:33:23.567
Me?

00:33:26.397 --> 00:33:28.023
Do I have that right?

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.480
And whatever wrong she did,

00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:36.104
she's family.

00:33:37.689 --> 00:33:39.564
I never abandon family.

00:33:45.884 --> 00:33:46.941
What about me?

00:33:49.291 --> 00:33:50.629
Are you my family?

00:33:52.564 --> 00:33:57.689
Wasn't I until now?

00:33:57.978 --> 00:33:59.987
Then how could you
do that to Eunsoo?

00:34:12.104 --> 00:34:14.105
RYU HYEONGSU
HAPPY BANK MANAGER

00:34:22.897 --> 00:34:26.104
That's how you took
Eunsoo's full-time position.

00:34:28.897 --> 00:34:31.350
I kept quiet back then because

00:34:31.631 --> 00:34:36.647
if Eunsoo lost her job
and her only friend,

00:34:36.689 --> 00:34:39.897
I knew my wife
would've been devastated.

00:34:40.397 --> 00:34:41.355
Do you understand?

00:34:44.212 --> 00:34:48.747
I'll take care of my family.
You stay out of it.

00:34:49.647 --> 00:34:52.104
Stay away from Eunsoo and Sua.

00:34:53.459 --> 00:34:54.668
Dojin...

00:34:59.495 --> 00:35:00.680
I won't see you out.

00:35:47.553 --> 00:35:48.968
It's Eunsoo's fault.

00:35:53.736 --> 00:35:55.033
So why abandon me?

00:35:58.487 --> 00:36:00.627
Back then, I didn't know.

00:36:02.221 --> 00:36:07.104
That the end of my story
would become someone else's beginning.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.605
I'm Choi Gyeongdo from
Gwangnam Police Station.

00:36:10.647 --> 00:36:11.564
Hello.

00:36:11.605 --> 00:36:14.104
Inspector Jang downstairs
was injured and hospitalized.

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:15.104
Oh, dear.

00:36:15.104 --> 00:36:17.439
Can you open the door
so I can get his clothes?

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.897
Sure, no problem.

00:38:50.159 --> 00:38:51.112
And?

00:38:55.104 --> 00:38:56.104
Really?

00:39:03.104 --> 00:39:04.105
Yeah, got it.

00:39:10.814 --> 00:39:12.814
Why? What happened?

00:39:13.174 --> 00:39:14.446
You know...

00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:20.230
Our team needs to go
see a shaman.

00:39:28.605 --> 00:39:32.939
We traced the burner phone
found in Sgt. Choi's drawer.

00:39:33.023 --> 00:39:36.856
Every call was aligned with his location.

00:39:37.856 --> 00:39:42.023
It was one of the pieces that
confirmed the suspicion about Sgt. Choi.

00:39:43.305 --> 00:39:45.328
But at Sgt. Choi's request,

00:39:45.344 --> 00:39:49.272
we checked the locations
of every other detective at those times.

00:39:49.695 --> 00:39:53.350
And one person
was always with Sgt. Choi.

00:39:53.936 --> 00:39:57.017
It was you, Inspector Jang.

00:40:00.981 --> 00:40:04.397
CALL-DETAIL RECORDS

00:40:08.299 --> 00:40:09.400
We're on the same team.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.360
Practically partners.
Of course, I was with him.

00:40:14.666 --> 00:40:17.772
You used the burner phone
only when I was around.

00:40:18.731 --> 00:40:21.105
So you can pin it on me.

00:40:24.023 --> 00:40:25.545
Watch your mouth.

00:40:25.921 --> 00:40:27.681
Hey, Choi Gyeongdo.

00:40:29.104 --> 00:40:33.704
I pulled you out of the trench
and put you in my team.

00:40:35.104 --> 00:40:36.314
You're the one who betrayed me.

00:40:38.272 --> 00:40:39.314
Betray you?

00:40:42.647 --> 00:40:44.104
Hey, calm down.

00:40:44.605 --> 00:40:49.897
I really respected you,
did you know that?

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.844
I thought you were someone
worth following.

00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:11.104
Do I have to keep listening to this?

00:41:12.772 --> 00:41:14.814
I don't think there's anything left
for me to explain.

00:41:14.993 --> 00:41:18.265
Then what about the 800 million won
found at your house?

00:41:20.104 --> 00:41:23.104
Investigation and search mean
sensing the discord in a space.

00:41:23.873 --> 00:41:25.416
That's what you always told me.

00:41:26.981 --> 00:41:28.397
So I found it.

00:41:29.326 --> 00:41:32.534
In that shabby room,
the only new thing was the wallpaper.

00:41:34.432 --> 00:41:36.592
You obviously didn't report it
as an asset.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:40.459
How do you explain that?

00:41:43.756 --> 00:41:44.714
I can't.

00:41:46.104 --> 00:41:48.744
If I had that kind of money,
why would I live there?

00:41:49.522 --> 00:41:50.314
It's not my money.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.369
- Cut the crap.
- More importantly...

00:41:54.023 --> 00:41:55.501
Isn't that illegal entry?

00:41:56.104 --> 00:41:58.064
The door couldn't have been open.

00:41:58.439 --> 00:42:00.104
Did you break a window
to get in?

00:42:01.294 --> 00:42:05.397
All the evidence
you collected is inadmissible.

00:42:05.439 --> 00:42:07.897
Maybe in court,
but not for the Internal Affairs.

00:42:08.647 --> 00:42:11.605
Besides, I went there
on Detective Park's orders

00:42:11.647 --> 00:42:14.355
to get your stuff for the hospital.

00:42:15.448 --> 00:42:17.477
The landlady herself opened the door.

00:42:41.981 --> 00:42:44.647
Did you really think everything
would go your way?

00:42:48.064 --> 00:42:50.104
The world doesn't work like that.

00:42:51.907 --> 00:42:53.072
Mr. Jang Taegu.

00:43:01.731 --> 00:43:02.814
I'm impressed.

00:43:04.772 --> 00:43:06.397
You really took it up a notch.

00:43:08.104 --> 00:43:09.689
I did learn from the best.

00:43:27.856 --> 00:43:31.689
Jang Taegu has been
officially listed as a suspect.

00:43:34.439 --> 00:43:35.856
Shit...

00:43:39.522 --> 00:43:43.348
The HQ wants him.
Transport him there yourself.

00:43:46.415 --> 00:43:47.419
Yes, sir.

00:44:01.574 --> 00:44:03.647
Just out of curiosity...

00:44:04.032 --> 00:44:08.073
Three years ago,
when I first caught the Phantom underling,

00:44:10.104 --> 00:44:12.035
they found cash in my trunk.

00:44:12.785 --> 00:44:14.499
I got suspended because of that.

00:44:17.104 --> 00:44:18.188
Was it you?

00:44:23.104 --> 00:44:26.105
It was you...
Shit.

00:44:26.731 --> 00:44:28.104
I didn't even realize.

00:44:28.647 --> 00:44:33.564
Hey, you borrowed
money from me all happy.

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.605
Now you feel wronged?

00:44:40.197 --> 00:44:41.990
I wonder if they're on the move.

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:55.897

00:45:00.272 --> 00:45:01.897
It's done.

LEE KYUNG

00:45:10.626 --> 00:45:12.959
What are you doing?
You can't come in!

00:45:17.254 --> 00:45:18.355
Who are you people?

00:45:18.506 --> 00:45:19.386
What the...

00:45:19.522 --> 00:45:21.104
Long time no see.

00:45:21.731 --> 00:45:24.897
I've been looking everywhere for you.

00:45:27.397 --> 00:45:31.807
Damn, seeing your face
brings it all back.

00:45:32.188 --> 00:45:35.064
Of you and your dad
begging me for forgiveness.

00:45:37.897 --> 00:45:42.104
You pleaded with me
to let you off that one time.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:45.889
Turns out you and
your brother are rats.

00:45:47.104 --> 00:45:48.856
It must be a family thing.

00:45:51.595 --> 00:45:52.608
0.5%?

00:45:54.772 --> 00:45:58.856
You think you can kick me out
with just a shareholder proposal?

GOLD ART GALLERY

00:46:03.772 --> 00:46:07.439
Wow, what a dream you have!

00:46:10.793 --> 00:46:12.161
Is she with you as well?

00:46:13.328 --> 00:46:15.245
Did you steal back the drug?

00:46:16.731 --> 00:46:19.564
- I have no idea what you're saying.
- Shut up.

00:46:21.564 --> 00:46:23.731
Where's your brother?

00:46:35.647 --> 00:46:39.104
Last class before the break, huh?

00:46:39.104 --> 00:46:43.104
- Mr. Lee, we'll miss you.
- Seriously.

00:46:47.306 --> 00:46:49.096
BIG BRO

00:46:49.439 --> 00:46:50.689
Hold on.

00:46:53.981 --> 00:46:54.761
Yeah.

00:46:55.104 --> 00:46:57.188
Oh, Madam.

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:00.480
You didn't have to.
You should've just come.

00:47:01.104 --> 00:47:04.104
It's under fifty thousand won,
please take it.

00:47:05.033 --> 00:47:08.034
Thank you.
By the way,

00:47:08.147 --> 00:47:11.944
will Sua not be coming back
from Japan?

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:26.897
Your case was all cleared.

00:47:26.939 --> 00:47:31.064
Yujeong testified,
and the art tutor helped too.

00:47:34.814 --> 00:47:37.314
I'm just going to say bye.

00:47:48.814 --> 00:47:50.023
This way.

00:47:51.689 --> 00:47:52.981
Keep going.

00:47:55.105 --> 00:47:57.147
Surprise!

00:47:57.856 --> 00:47:58.814
Kang Hwirim?

00:47:58.856 --> 00:48:00.480
Long time no see, James.

00:48:01.049 --> 00:48:03.884
Or should I call you Lee Kyung?

00:48:05.104 --> 00:48:08.972
Did you get taller in juvie?
I didn't recognize you.

00:48:09.772 --> 00:48:12.897
- You...
- Wow, extraordinary.

00:48:12.939 --> 00:48:16.230
You have an impressive room.

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:30.272

DECEMBER 8TH
TWON HOLDINGS IR - D DAY

00:48:36.105 --> 00:48:39.772
Honestly, I'm kind of touched.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.715
I feel loved, you know?

00:48:44.314 --> 00:48:48.104
So I want to return the favor.

00:48:48.981 --> 00:48:50.564
Hope you like it.

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:52.188
What?

00:48:53.657 --> 00:48:57.117
Mr. Lee Kyung.
Drug Crimes Unit.

00:48:57.461 --> 00:49:01.064
You're under arrest for drug trafficking.

00:49:01.981 --> 00:49:04.104
What do you think?
Do you like it?

00:49:04.104 --> 00:49:08.522
I wish I could've seen your face.
Too bad I missed it.

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:11.981
Arrest him.

00:49:12.522 --> 00:49:15.124
You lost again, dumbass.

00:49:16.564 --> 00:49:18.314
You have the right to remain silent.

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:20.647
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Hand me your phone.

00:49:20.689 --> 00:49:24.355
Anything you say
can be used against you.

ART ROOM

00:49:41.647 --> 00:49:42.490
Mr. Lee...

00:50:06.104 --> 00:50:07.355
Clean it up.

00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:52.104
We'll be arriving any minute.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.104
Be cooperative there,

00:50:58.104 --> 00:51:00.564
and pay for your crimes.

00:51:18.613 --> 00:51:19.822
Gyeongdo was right.

00:51:21.508 --> 00:51:22.314
What?

00:51:22.383 --> 00:51:29.104
Things never happen as planned.

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.105
Is that the art tutor?

00:53:03.814 --> 00:53:05.104
Hey!

00:53:35.104 --> 00:53:36.973
What? Huh?

00:53:37.355 --> 00:53:38.647
What!

00:54:21.597 --> 00:54:22.771
Hey...

00:54:23.105 --> 00:54:26.605
I know you're not fully recovered,

00:54:26.647 --> 00:54:29.814
but we're really out of time now.

00:54:30.817 --> 00:54:33.109
It's Japan,
so you'll get there fast.

00:54:35.626 --> 00:54:39.166
Deposit this before
you head to the airport.

00:54:41.104 --> 00:54:44.023
It'll cover treatment
and immediate living costs.

00:54:44.064 --> 00:54:47.465
I made it untraceable,
so don't worry.

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.897
What about you?

00:54:52.728 --> 00:54:53.672
You're not coming?

00:54:56.844 --> 00:54:58.552
I can't.

00:54:59.064 --> 00:55:00.211
Because of that tutor?

00:55:07.246 --> 00:55:08.104
Oh my God.

00:55:08.104 --> 00:55:10.981
Mr. Lee was a drug dealer?
For real?

00:55:11.023 --> 00:55:13.272
They say Jinhee's mom
was his client.

00:55:13.314 --> 00:55:16.772
Wow, it's already in the news.
This is serious.

00:55:20.104 --> 00:55:22.104
MIDDLE SCHOOL ART TUTOR
ARRESTED FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING

00:55:32.353 --> 00:55:35.104
If I get caught while coming along,

00:55:35.104 --> 00:55:37.564
you and Sua may not
be able to depart.

00:55:37.605 --> 00:55:43.216
Go with Sua first.
I'll follow you after I sort things out.

00:55:56.897 --> 00:55:58.397
I won't leave you behind.

00:55:58.439 --> 00:55:59.731
Honey!

00:55:59.772 --> 00:56:03.188
You want me to live off the money
you made like this?

00:56:03.605 --> 00:56:06.522
I can't.
I'd rather die.

00:56:06.772 --> 00:56:09.064
How can you say that?

00:56:09.397 --> 00:56:11.856
Do you know
what I did to keep you alive?

00:56:11.897 --> 00:56:13.564
That's exactly why!

00:56:17.482 --> 00:56:18.969
Do you think I really wanted...

00:56:20.814 --> 00:56:25.147
...to live despite
making you turn into this?

00:56:26.736 --> 00:56:28.821
Did you really think that?

00:56:29.149 --> 00:56:33.519
I hate myself for it, okay?

00:56:35.023 --> 00:56:41.108
If only I'd just died
on that hospital roof...

00:56:41.694 --> 00:56:43.023
No.

00:56:43.814 --> 00:56:46.104
No, no.
It's not like that.

00:56:46.188 --> 00:56:50.104
I did it because I need you.

00:56:51.104 --> 00:56:54.397
I couldn't bear the thought

00:56:54.439 --> 00:56:57.355
of losing you from my life.

00:57:01.709 --> 00:57:03.551
That's why I did it.

00:57:06.088 --> 00:57:09.125
We can be a little greedy, right?

00:57:09.235 --> 00:57:11.203
I never asked for anything ever.

00:57:11.266 --> 00:57:16.230
All I'm asking for
is you, Sua, and our house.

00:57:23.439 --> 00:57:24.814
Eunsoo.

00:57:26.256 --> 00:57:30.387
Let's give it all up and leave.

00:57:32.873 --> 00:57:34.231
Don't be ridiculous.

00:57:35.104 --> 00:57:38.480
What about your treatment?
Where will we live?

00:57:38.522 --> 00:57:40.522
We need at least this much money...

00:57:40.564 --> 00:57:42.104
We can do without it.

00:57:43.897 --> 00:57:45.836
We've managed fine till now.

00:57:48.188 --> 00:57:52.105
So let's leave it all behind.

00:57:53.104 --> 00:57:55.104
That's the only way it'll end.

00:57:57.246 --> 00:58:02.104
Let's give everything up,
pay for our sins, and go together.

00:58:02.570 --> 00:58:03.897
I'll wait for you.

00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:07.023
If people curse us,
we'll hear it together.

00:58:07.731 --> 00:58:09.856
If they throw stones,
we'll take them together.

00:58:11.374 --> 00:58:13.439
It'll be hard on Sua,

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:17.622
but if the three of us are together,
we'll be okay.

00:58:59.712 --> 00:59:01.002
Doctor...

00:59:02.856 --> 00:59:05.962
I'm sorry.
I did all I could.

00:59:08.272 --> 00:59:09.981
What do you mean?

00:59:10.023 --> 00:59:13.480
Is Detective Park dead?
Is he really dead?

00:59:13.522 --> 00:59:15.981
- I'm so sorry.
- Maybe there was a mistake.

00:59:17.564 --> 00:59:18.897
Please!

00:59:21.856 --> 00:59:25.104
You promised we'd catch
the culprit together!

00:59:25.105 --> 00:59:28.064
Don't break your promise!

01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:08.068
Let's go turn ourselves in.

01:00:11.459 --> 01:00:12.967
I'll be with you.

01:01:18.314 --> 01:01:21.104
Water. Give me water.

01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:23.397
Who are you?

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:32.814
Going somewhere?

01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:43.939
Who are you?

01:01:47.064 --> 01:01:49.147
Honey! Honey!

01:01:51.159 --> 01:01:53.077
I'm in a really bad mood.

01:01:54.758 --> 01:01:58.104
So just answer me straight, got it?

01:02:02.331 --> 01:02:03.498
Is that the money?

01:02:14.394 --> 01:02:15.413
Where's the drug?

01:02:18.104 --> 01:02:19.104
The drug!

01:02:24.355 --> 01:02:27.064
Look, it's in a private safe.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.564
Here's the address and passcode.

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:32.939
Here.

01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:50.731
I'm not lying.
Everything's there.

01:03:39.104 --> 01:03:40.397
But the numbers don't add up.

01:03:51.064 --> 01:03:52.147
Unfortunately,

01:03:54.939 --> 01:03:57.272
the thing I hate most
is unfairness.

01:04:23.043 --> 01:04:27.230
Why is Assistant Choi telling me
to cover up for her miscounting?

01:04:27.272 --> 01:04:28.564
It sucks to be a temporary employee.

01:04:32.814 --> 01:04:34.480
No discrimination my ass.

01:04:34.522 --> 01:04:37.104
They never even had lunch with us.

01:04:40.698 --> 01:04:41.657
You're right.

01:04:44.776 --> 01:04:47.272
Guess Assistant Choi
doesn't even eat.

01:04:47.564 --> 01:04:51.023
- I need to go.
- Have some more. You haven't finished.

01:04:51.645 --> 01:04:52.834
Enjoy your lunch.

01:04:57.105 --> 01:04:58.939
2004 HAPPY BANK
FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:03.823
Gosh, am I going to fail again?

01:05:08.981 --> 01:05:10.316
Is this seat taken?

01:05:13.188 --> 01:05:14.522
Ah, no.

01:05:21.769 --> 01:05:23.233
You're Eunsoo, right?

01:05:24.856 --> 01:05:25.952
EMPLOYEE KANG EUNSOO

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.772
Oh, yes.

01:05:27.814 --> 01:05:31.237
I'm in HR,
so I'm good with names.

01:05:31.314 --> 01:05:32.862
Oh, I see.

01:05:33.647 --> 01:05:36.104
I've heard only
good things about you.

01:05:36.104 --> 01:05:39.339
People say you're diligent
and hardworking.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.689
Thank you.
It's about the only thing I'm good at.

01:05:42.824 --> 01:05:44.724
And that's amazing.

01:05:45.511 --> 01:05:48.761
Working hard is the most difficult.

01:05:49.689 --> 01:05:51.104
Not everyone can do it.

01:05:53.605 --> 01:05:55.023
Thank you.

01:05:59.198 --> 01:06:01.353
- Over here!
- Oh, yeah.
