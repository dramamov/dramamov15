00:01:01.288 --> 00:01:03.480
I met with those relocated residents
this afternoon.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.560
Three buildings,
a total of 86 households.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.000
Each family wants three million.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.800
Three million...

00:01:16.444 --> 00:01:18.360
How much cash flow
does our company still have?

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.910
I'll go ask finance.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.310
Conservatively estimated,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.910
it's no more than eighty million.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.520
Okay.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.340
(Reception Room)

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.080
May I come in?

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.000
Baozhu just called.

00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:45.733
She asked me
to go to the hospital with you.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.750
Ms. Gu.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.360
I heard Xinghan seems
to be facing some cash flow issue.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.720
Yes.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.830
We invested a large amount of funds

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.110
into project development.

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.800
Now the public opinion
has turned against us.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.470
The former partners
have lost confidence in us.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.520
Many of them

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.470
have completely cut off contact with us.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.360
Can we use the new apartments
as compensation?

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.150
I can try to negotiate.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.600
Thank you for helping the company
with the positive press release.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.640
Anyway, we must first stabilize
the company internally.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:28.420
Once shareholders' interests
are affected,

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.710
things will get even messier.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.550
I'll leave you two to it.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.080
I'll go talk to them again.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.150
Okay.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.870
I know you have a lot to deal with.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.920
It's okay.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.360
Everything will be fine.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.080
In what capacity
are you caring about me now?

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.360
As Tang Baozhu's best friend,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520
or...

00:03:35.777 --> 00:03:36.711
I'm sorry.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.550
I admit I'm a very conflicted person.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.200
Perhaps I'll never learn
how to confront my feelings.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.520
Everything that appears in my life,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.590
I can't help but wonder
if it truly belongs to me.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.520
If you need me,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.110
let me stay by your side,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.240

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.340
What?

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.910
Lu has passed away...

Baozhu

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.270

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.560
(I apologize.)

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.390
