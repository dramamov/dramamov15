[Sword and Beloved]

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.520
[Episode 2]

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.040
Huaizhu,

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.950
over these years,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.510
Fugui has lost all the joys

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.000
a person should have,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.630
yet I can't go soft on him.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.000
I can't let down

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.130
everything you've done for me
and for the Yiqi Alliance.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.590
A Soldier

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.120
is born only to slay demons.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.800
Soldier,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.680
wait.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.240
It's me,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.850
the little spider who sent you the letter.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.900
This is horseweed.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.710
It has a great hemostatic effect.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.150
Here.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.800
No need.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.240
Your father was really mean

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.400
to you.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.360
Plus,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.750
it's your birthday.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.310
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.570
I didn't see anything.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.910
Take this.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.280
It contains pinellia, Dahurian angelica,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.080
dried beauveria, and cinnabar.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.520
If you simmer it for six hours,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.910
it's good for internal injuries too.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.800
And...

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.800
Hey!

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.560
I haven't finished yet.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.000
Why are you always like this?

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.960
Your closest friends and loved ones

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.910
dying one by one before your eyesâ€”

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.150
Do you know

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.120
what it's like?

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.760
The Hongye underneath the Jinlan Mask

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.660
lost because of his emotions.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.000
He'll never forgive himself!

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.310
I won't allow you to follow in
his footsteps!

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.430
Father,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.280
what exactly are you hiding?

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.680
This is...

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.510
the Black Grief Tree?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.120
No.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.510
It can't be.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.190
I've already cut it down.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.720
This is fake.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.720
It's an illusion.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.390
Really?

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.480
Wangquan Hongye,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.870
long time no see.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.070
Third Young Master of Aolai tried his best

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.480
to draw a circle

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.630
and protect you all,

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.360
but you all arrogantly left the circle

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.890
and got yourselves killed.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.630
All these years,

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.750
you think you can change anything

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.270
by raising a Soldier?

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.630
Love is dying and hatred is rising
in the world.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.690
The Black Grief Tree will
eventually come back to life.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.870
And I

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.000
am waiting to meet Wangquan Fugui,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.920
the blade you personally

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.070
sharpened.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.510
It's a dream.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560
But why is my dream

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.850
always connected to the outer circle?

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.000
Could it be...

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.510
Wangquan Hongye,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.680
did you dream of me again?

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.810
As long as there's hatred in the world,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.240
you won't be able to really kill me.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.430
Just wait

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.240
to pay with your blood.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.560
Don't be shameless.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.380
The Soldier
celebrated his birthday alone?

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.240
What kind of intelligence is this?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.680
Madam Yin is not patient.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.159
If she decides to
hold someone accountable,

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:36.510
can we take the responsibility?

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.390
If she did,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.800
she'd go to you first.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.050
Don't think I don't know

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.610
you credit yourself

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.830
for all my work.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.750
So what?

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.600
Demons go by the law of
survival of the fittest.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.600
Crushing you

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.600
is as easy as killing an ant.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.750
Don't forget

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.390
that without me,

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.880
you can't even enter

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.750
the Soldier's home by yourself.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.560
You...

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.440
How dare you threaten me?

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.340
I know what to do

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.330
about the Soldier.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.800
Hey!

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.630
After I get the Soldier's intelligence,

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.190
I'll kill you!

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.310
Last night,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.240
I dreamed about the outside again.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.960
Ever since I returned from the outside

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.040
my consciousness has been
connected to the outside.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.040
I can feel that...

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.190
it

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.750
is back.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.160
Recently, hostility has increased

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.220
in the Demon Realm.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.430
More and more murderers
have crossed the border.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.360
I wonder

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.840
if it's related to the Black Fox.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:42.800
So,

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.470
Fugui must master
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike quickly.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.600
But Young Master Fugui

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.270
is already doing his best.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.560
Let's not talk about this anymore.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.390
How's the Li family preparing

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.990
for the Blue Sky Convention?

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.690
The Blue Sky Convention

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.860
is a grand event for the Yiqi Alliance

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.430
to select young talents.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.240
This time,
the Peach Garden's Li family is hosting.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.190
Master Li is the most reliable.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.240
He has already sent out invitations

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.800
and has made all preparations

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.530
for the convention next month.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.190
Quzhuo probably didn't expect

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.750
that one day,

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.920
he'd become the most reliable master
of the Li family.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.870
His brother would be pleased

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.360
if he knew in heaven.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:32.870
Yes.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.010
There's a guest

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.320
not on the invitation list.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:38.750
Who?

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:41.970
Fifteen years ago,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.630
he practiced witchcraft
with his demon core.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.720
After he was discovered,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.600
you

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.640
took away his Wangquan surname

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.000
and exiled him to the Western Regions.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.060
It's Quan Jingting, Master Quan.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.840
It's my cousin?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.030
I heard that he's very popular
among the people

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.650
after subduing demons

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.240
in the Western Regions

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.440
and also gained fans?

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:10.240
Yes.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.960
He brought your previously
favorite nephew, Young Master Rumu,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.910
with him.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.750
I heard

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.930
they are on their way already.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.150
Great!

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:46.960
Get out of the way!

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.320
Move!

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:47.970
Get lost!

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:48.800
Get lost!

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.240
I'm talking to you!

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:52.480
Get lost!

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.540
I'm talking to you!

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.920
Go over there!

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.360
You...

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:56.720
You...

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.510
Leave!

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.240
Let's go.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.670
What are they carrying?

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.630
It looks heavy.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.750
Who are these people?

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.600
Shush.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.960
No matter who it is,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.030
theyâ€™re not someone we should mess with.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.120
Stop talking.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.080
[Quan Jingting,
Master of the Frontier Quan Family]

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.080
Where is Wangquan Shouyi?

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.530
Why would the elder of the Wangquan family

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.630
be here

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.480
in my small tobacco house?

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.840
Stop pretending.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.840
Do you think I don't know

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.440
who your true boss is

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.560
and what this tobacco house
is truly selling?

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.450
Extracting demon cores alive

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.960
and developing forbidden medicine...

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.220
You don't dare to sell it
under the Wangquan Manor's watch,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.870
so you're selling it
in the Western Regions.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.320
Do you need me to give

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.150
the evidence to Wangquan Hongye?

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.100
Are you afraid?

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.360
Let me show you something else.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.240
Is that basalt?

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.000
It looks so powerful.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.150
Whose swordsmanship is this?

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.750
Could it be

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.550
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike?

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.030
This...

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:03.960
This is...

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:09.630
My son, Rumu,

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.150
is an extraordinary genius.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.600
Two years ago,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.280
when he fought dragon demons alone
in the Western Regions

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.940
and performed this sword move...

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.360
It was already close to
the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.870
I was the legitimate heir of Wangquan.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.410
Many years ago,

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.960
just because of a small mistake,

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.440
Wangquan Hongye forced me
to change my surname to Quan

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.240
and exiled me
to the Western Regions.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.320
The 15-year grudge
for having my surname takenâ€”

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.550
Iâ€™ve been waiting for this very day.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.480
Wangquan Shouyi!

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.960
You coward!

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.800
Do you only dare to hide in this brothel,

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.360
smoking opium,

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.480
and cursing Wangquan Hongye
behind his back?

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.750
Elder Wangquan welcomes Master Quan.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.480
Wangquan Shouyi.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.550
Where are the people persecutred
by Wangquan Hongye

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.870
that you promised me you'd gather?

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:03.720
Technically,

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.030
I'm your uncle.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.720
Right?

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.150
You have no manners at all.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.750
My son Rumu

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.670
will kill the Soldier
during the Blue Sky Convention

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.330
and seize the Wangquan Sword.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.690
The Yiqi Alliance has many fence-riders.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.440
If my son takes the lead,

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.670
you command everyone

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.130
to follow me in revolting.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.240
The Yiqi Alliance

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.440
will be in our hands.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.790
What a foolish and simple plan.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.030
I've always been simple
and straightforward.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.980
What about you, Uncle?

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.840
If Wangquan Hongye found out
you developed evil medicine

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.960
and sold them,

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.520
have you ever thought

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.270
what would happen to you?

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.320
In the chess game of life,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.130
there are no perfect plans.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.750
Heroes are made by their times.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.030
If we work together

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.440
and succeed,

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.550
the Yiqi Alliance

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.840
will be your cash cow.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.390
If you can also

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.000
provide me a pill

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.150
to improve martial power

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.000
and my son takes it,

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.910
the plan will be even more perfect.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.200
Even a vicious tiger doesn't eat its cubs.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.120
I don't want your

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.580
tiny, disgusting things.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.320
I know you have better ones.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:03.910
Soldier.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.510
You're back?

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.670
Here,

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:07.360
a towel.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.990
I forgot to give you
a birthday gift yesterday.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.200
This chrysanthemum

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.930
is for you, Young Master Fugui.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.170
Aren't you afraid of me?

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:20.840
I'm not.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.600
Really?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.080
No need to scare me.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.270
I know

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.330
you don't hurt the weak and innocent.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.910
If you wanted to kill me,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.120
you would have killed me

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.550
when you first met me.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.240
Are you sure?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:39.840
Is it because

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.480
you're a spy sent by the Silk Cave?

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.140
Soldier...

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.440
How...

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.270
How did you find out?

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.930
Madam Yin, Mistress of the Silk Cave,

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.030
hates me so much.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.340
Over the years,

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.510
she's trained countless spiders

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.710
to spy on information

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.910
and even sent demons to kill me.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.930
Her spiders can weave brocade

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.810
and send information
with the vibration of the webs.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.540
They're even better at lying.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:16.670
You approached Feng Tingyun

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.740
to please her and send her letters

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.829
just to

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.400
help you get close to my residence.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:23.680
Am I right?

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.480
You can leave now.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:34.730
Soldier,

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.480
I beg you.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.990
You've crossed the line.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.550
Allowing you to leave

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.700
is the greatest leniency I can offer.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.440
Please, Soldier.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.350
There are thousands of spiders

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.440
in the Silk Cave.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.960
Our lives are as worthless as weeds.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.420
If I go back empty-handed,

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.750
I'll definitely die.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:53.080
Soldier,

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.310
please have mercy.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.440
Let me stay.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.640
Soldier,

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.440
I realized that you love maps.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.750
Do you want to go somewhere?

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.510
Soldier,

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.830
I can weave brocade paintings.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.230
I've been to many places.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.840
I can weave whatever scenery

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.310
you'd like to see.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.240
Just let me stay.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.480
That horrible male spider

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.550
hit me so hard.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.440
No.12580,

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.550
when life and death are at stake,

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.110
you can't...

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.590
I'm...

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.440
I've fixed

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.640
your broken bones,

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.680
but your injury must be

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.110
treated with a medicine bath
for a few days.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.920
Thank you.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.110
I'm so small.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.310
It must have taken a lot of effort

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.920
to bandage me so well.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.840
I saw you in the Eastern City.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.160
Eastern City?

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.310
Young Master,

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.910
someone used spider silk
to stop his bleeding.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.270
Why did you save him?

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.960
Shouldn't demons hate humans?

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.310
I...

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.350
Forget it.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:42.880
Soldier,

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.680
you let me stay

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.680
because of what I said, right?

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.490
Is there really some scenery
you want to see?

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:01.640
Soldier,

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.880
what are you looking at?

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.000
Have you been to the
Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.790
The Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.050
I've never been there.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.310
But I've seen a bamboo forest by the water

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.640
with a pretty pavilion.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:20.590
Maybe

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:21.920
they're about the same.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.150
By the wayâ€”

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:31.510
It's so bitter.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:35.720
Weave it.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.960
Really?

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.440
You're letting me stay?

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.170
Don't worry.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.880
I'll definitely weave it beautifully.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.410
Soldier,

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.350
this medicine is too bitter.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.480
Do you have candy?

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.510
No.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.160
Oh.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.550
Where should I sleep?

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:49.480
Wherever you want.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.880
But for spiders
to spit out beautiful silk,

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.720
we must eat well, sleep well,

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.880
and be in a good mood.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.170
This place is so comfortable.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.280
I didn't know

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.350
you could fold paper boats.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.250
I saw someone do it once.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.440
Don't you sleep?

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.030
Your room is so shabby.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.860
You don't even have a maid.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.510
Isn't Wangquan Manor

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:15.910
the richest in the world?

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.920
Where is this
Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.960
you mentioned?

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.370
Is it important to you?

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.400
Why are you leaving?

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.940
Are you going to sleep?

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.640
Then tonight,

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:27.790
I'll sleep here.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:29.550
See you tomorrow.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.880
Soldier,

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.770
good night.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.000
I slept so well.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.270
Good morning, Young Master Fugui.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.200
You're up early.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.110
Did you go practice your sword?

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.370
None of your business.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.640
Young Master Fugui,

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.550
you must be tired from practicing.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:08.480
Have some tea.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:10.750
I guess

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.110
you don't like the title of Soldier.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.130
Young Master Fugui,

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.160
one of my arms hasn't recovered.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.030
The weaving may be slower.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.750
Delaying things

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.360
won't get you any useful intelligence.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.090
Go do your own thing.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.960
But the medicine is really bitter.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.830
Young Master Fugui,

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.360
do you really have no candy?

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.480
If there's candy,

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.500
I might weave the brocade faster.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.070
By the way, Young Master Fugui,

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.600
has Lady Feng looked for me?

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.780
I've asked someone to inform Feng

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.110
that a spider

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.400
was chased away by me.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.750
Actually, Lady Feng

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.310
is a nice person.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.640
She's innocent yet confident.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:57.110
Unlike me,

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.000
I have to put in all my effort
just to save my life.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.510
In my opinion,

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:03.240
you two are a good match.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.440
Why are you always cold to her?

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.070
I...

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:07.070
I'm sorry, Young Master Fugui.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.720
I was wrong.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.240
I'll shut up.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.000
Iâ€™m leaving.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:23.980
â™ª The past is mottled and worn,
a life bound by blades â™ª

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:30.280
â™ª This life, adrift and wasted,
still has my heart chasing the wind â™ª

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.020
â™ª I plant a tale deep within my soul â™ª

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.170
â™ª Even if, in the end â™ª

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.730
â™ª I can only sigh at fate's cruel jest â™ª

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:46.640
Young Master Fugui.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.350
Look here.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.480
There are many trees here.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.030
The other side of the forest
is a mountain,

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:52.960
a big mountain range!

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.550
There are very, very high mountains,

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.110
with a big pool of water in the middle.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.380
â™ª I once swore my sword would
sweep away all injustice â™ª

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.270
â™ª Yet returning, I wander through
rains of blood in search of old paths â™ª

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:10.110
â™ª Perhaps this life is but
a fleeting dream â™ª

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.250
â™ª I raise my sword to cleave
the mountain of destiny â™ª

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.500
â™ª Who will share this journey with me? â™ª

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.210
â™ª I've crossed thousands of peaks
and rivers wide â™ª

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.390
â™ª Unafraid as fate mocks
that I'm still young â™ª

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.920
â™ª Unafraid of countless swords
piercing my heart â™ª

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.870
â™ª Nor of the sword drawn,
pointing toward the abyss â™ª

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.840
â™ª Unafraid as old grudges
scatter to the wind â™ª

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.260
â™ª Unafraid to stand among the clouds â™ª

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.250
â™ª For my heart, Heaven and Earth
shall bear witness â™ª

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.210
â™ª Unafraid as fate mocks
that I'm still young â™ª

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.740
â™ª Unafraid of countless swords
piercing my heart â™ª

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:56.500
â™ª Nor of the sword drawn,
pointing toward the abyss â™ª

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.720
â™ª Unafraid as old grudges
scatter to the wind â™ª

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.250
â™ª Unafraid to stand among the clouds â™ª

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:06.230
â™ª For my heart, Heaven and Earth
shall bear witness â™ª

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.270
Young Master Fugui,

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.030
the brocade

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.030
is almost done.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.350
Okay.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.000
When it's done,

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.590
I should go.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.330
Young Master Fugui,

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.070
you've been practicing swordsmanship
in the courtyard recently.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.400
You do each move slowly.

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.190
Are you purposely showing me

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.880
so I have something to report
when I return?

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.210
Are you that confident?

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.030
Do you think

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.720
we'll never be your match?

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.110
In the Silk Cave,

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.270
everyone hates Soldiers.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.590
When my little brother refused to sleep,

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.450
I would use Soldiers to scare him.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.590
In our eyes,

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:04.680
Soldiers

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:07.440
are the most terrifying monsters.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.720
Young Master Fugui, in your eyes...

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.790
what are we?

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:14.790
Demons.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:16.720
But demons have different sizes.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.830
Our kind

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.790
are the lowest-ranked demons

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.310
below the Demon King.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.510
We live...

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.680
We live like this wild chrysanthemum,

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.200
in clusters.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:29.960
If a big horse comes,

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.470
a huge patch can be killed at any moment.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.380
Back then in the Eastern City,

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:36.880
I was also sent there

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.200
to follow you.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.000
When I found that swordsman,

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.000
he was close to dying.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.510
But I understood the look

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.550
in his eyes.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:51.070
He wanted to live.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:54.750
I've seen

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.960
that look in the eyes

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.600
of many of my friends.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.770
When Soldiers come out,

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.320
you all kill
the most powerful demon kings.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.000
You probably never know

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.750
that there are many

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.650
insignificant beings like us
beneath your feet.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.240
Like this wild chrysanthemum,

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.750
we also want to live.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.850
Young Master Fugui,

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:22.750
thank you

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.860
for giving me a chance to live.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:27.830
Young Master Fugui.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.480
Look.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.000
Do I look like this wild chrysanthemum?

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.920
We'll be trampled to death anytime,

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.640
but

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.480
we both live happily.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.240
Young Master Fugui,

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.170
you're actually

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:39.880
very lonely, right?

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.880
I know

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.070
you are

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:43.600
a very, very gentle person.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:44.550
I hope

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:46.680
you can be happier too.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.930
No matter what,

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.200
I will remember

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.300
the days I spent here with you.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.440
The candy you gave me

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:57.960
was really sweet.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.880
â™ª It was you who opened the world,
the times transparent â™ª

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:57.130
â™ª At sunrise, I open my eyes;
at moon-fall, I wait for an answer â™ª

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:02.590
â™ª If the light shines through the night â™ª

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:03.720
Young Master Fugui,

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:04.560
this painting

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.550
â™ª Dawn will awaken â™ª

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.140
is the most beautiful
Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai I've seen.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.550
â™ª We never ask if fate is fair â™ª

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.880
Although you can't go out casually,

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:13.440
I believe

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.310
you will

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.960
â™ª You are the bright morning,
sinking into the sea â™ª

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.750
definitely see

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.880
the real Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.740
You won't be this lonely forever.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.480
Before that,
â™ª I am the reflection
of the clear puzzle in the wind â™ª

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.610
if there is a chance,

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.270
I want to weave

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:26.640
more beautiful scenery

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.790
to show you.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.000
â™ª If our so-called destiny
is to separate â™ª

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.510
Chrysanthemums
can't live past autumn,

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:32.960
but I will

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.400
try my best to live on.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:35.240
â™ª We'll exchange courage
in the sea and wind â™ª

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.070
Let me

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.400
become your eyes.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:40.790
â™ª Through the dream, I'll meet you again â™ª

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:41.920
Young Master Fugui,

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:43.550
goodbye.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.310
â™ª Not yet awake, but I believe I'm close â™ª

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.400
I don't know what I got from the painting

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.430
of the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai,

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:55.550
â™ª If weâ€™re destined to not be together â™ª

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:56.400
but I just...

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.160
love to look at it.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:01.070
And...

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:01.960
â™ª Be each otherâ€™s star
and meet at the end of destiny â™ª

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.090
Young Master Fugui,

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.160
after I leave,

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.050
when will you forget me?

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.410
I almost forgot.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.200
You have eidetic memory

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.550
You'll definitely remember me.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.790
I can no longer

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.550
casually kill demons again.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.000
Do demons

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.960
really all deserve to die?

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.160
You even learned his sword technique?

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.750
Not bad.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:37.920
I also learned
Soldier's diet, daily routine,

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.960
and other habits.

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:41.880
Does he have any weaknesses,

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.510
such as

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:44.880
emotionally

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:46.960
or physically?

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.160
No.12580 is slow.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.550
I couldn't find
any of his other weaknesses.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.640
Please punish me.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.160
Why would I punish you?

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.350
You successfully got close to the Soldier

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.400
and got such important information.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.030
I should reward you instead.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.680
Go ahead.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.550
Give this medicine to your brother.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:08.750
Thank you, Mistress.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.310
I shall take my leave.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.240
Mistress,

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.480
even with the Soldier's sword technique,

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.480
we still aren't his match.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.570
Of course this intelligence is useless.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.270
I didn't ask No.12580

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:26.920
to sneak into Wangquan Manor

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.880
for her to really gather intelligence.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.430
I want her

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:35.240
to become the Soldier's weakness.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.480
Go.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.550
Investigate the Soldier's whereabouts.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:39.480
At the right time,

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.550
arrange for the Soldier
to be reunited with his little spider.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:43.640
Yes, ma'am.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.480
Poor No.12580.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.440
She doesn't know anything yet.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.680
Young Master.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.740
There's a new mission.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.760
The Xin family

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.880
was forced by the Raccoon Dog Demon King

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.750
and had no choice

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:13.750
but to retreat into a land of miasma.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.070
The Xin family's master

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.870
asked the Yiqi Alliance for help

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.350
to defeat this demon.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.400
The raccoon dog demon clan isn't violent.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.750
They've never crossed the border
since it was drawn.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.110
Why have they

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.460
suddenly become radical?

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:35.200
The old Raccoon Dog Demon King

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.680
was kind and polite,

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.240
but recently,

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.960
the raccoon dog demon clan
had an internal conflict.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.020
A fierce raccoon dog demon named Fu Li

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.680
killed the old king,

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.000
and got a winged spirit pearl
that can absorb human spiritual power

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.160
and help lower demons transform.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.050
They used this pearl

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.480
to rampantly absorb the spiritual powers
of nearby human clans

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.550
for their own use.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.550
The people suffered a lot.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.960
That's why they're asking
the Yiqi Alliance for help.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.680
Fu Li?

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:01.750
I remember her.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.240
I read her information before.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:04.960
Young Master,

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.090
you've worked hard.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:10.480
You like flowers?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.880
Then I will

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.400
send more here.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.480
No need, Mr. Fei.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.410
In a few days,

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.000
Yiqi Alliance

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.920
will hold the Blue Sky Convention.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.750
Young Master,

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.200
you must win.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:29.970
Then Master will allow you

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.640
to go travel about.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.960
You won't have to keep looking at maps.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.430
In the future, I won't look at

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:46.310
such useless things.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.150
I don't mean to

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.310
reprimand you.

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.680
You are lonely.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.070
The more one does,
the more mistakes one makes.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.750
Anyway,

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.550
one thing.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:01.830
Don't blame the Master.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.680
If you want anything,

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.240
just tell me.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:09.630
Okay, Mr. Fei.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.440
Sister,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.000
you did a great job,

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.440
so Mistress specially rewarded us.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:21.150
Look.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.290
We have meat for dinner these days.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:24.920
You need to eat more.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.550
Look how skinny you are now.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:28.150
You're not as muscular as me.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.110
It's because I was injured
by the Yiqi Alliance.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.880
That's why I'm sickly and frail,

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.150
always a burden to you.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.510
Actually, not everyone

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.080
in the Yiqi Alliance is bad.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:40.800
You're so funny.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.040
How can there be good humans?

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:44.760
Listen up.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:46.480
Mistress's next mission

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.800
is to steal the winged spirit pearl
from the raccoon dog demon clan.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.190
Anyone that I call out

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.699
must go on the mission.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.760
No. 11788.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.920
No. 12309.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.590
No.12581.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.320
You all will depart today.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.190
Sister,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.070
I'll get going.

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:05.710
Wait!

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.270
I'll go on his behalf.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:40.070
You mere spider demons,

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:42.190
how dare you steal our magic weapon?

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.150
Do you want to die?

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:45.710
Am I going to die?

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.280
Demon King Fu Li,

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.930
come out to meet your death!

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.480
This is...

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.450
Young Master Fugui!

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:10.810
I've long heard of the name of
the Yiqi Alliance's Soldier.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.250
I'll see what you're all about today!

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.510
You're playing tricks.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.150
Come out!

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.400
[Raccoon Dog Demon King, Fu Li]

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.590
You are the Soldier?

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.630
Not that impressive.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.230
Today, I'll use you as a sacrifice

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.260
to celebrate me leading
the raccoon dog demon clan.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:26.150
The raccoon dog demon clan is the best
at transforming.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:28.080
Young Master, you must be careful.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.320
Soldier, die!

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.950
Young Master.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:56.530
All the lower demons in Huangfeng Ridge
have been eliminated.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.630
Return.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:16.400
It's her.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.840
Why is she here?

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:30.560
She's too badly injured

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:33.030
to be saved.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.230
Young Master Fugui...

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:38.680
Young Master Fugui.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:40.760
you probably never knew

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.480
there are many

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.800
insignificant beings like us
beneath your feet.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.530
Like this wild chrysanthemum,

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.280
we also want to live.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.570
Young Master Fugui,

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.550
thank you

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.620
for giving me a chance to live.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.710
Unless...

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.660
I can only revive her by refining my power

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.490
with this winged spirit pearl.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:12.230
Perhaps...

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.150
this is God's will.
