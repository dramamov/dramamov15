[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.920
[Episode 5]

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.430
Foxy Tang,

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.890
I bet on not taking a step back.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.810
Greetings, Sword King Yu,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.730
from your junior Tang Lici.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.120
You're that Tang Lici

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.400
from Zhoudi Tower?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.120
Master Jiang,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.870
you truly have
an extensive network of friends.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.670
Sword King Yu,

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.960
Mr. Tang...

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.520
What?

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.270
Is the mighty Sword King

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.160
planning to renege on his debt?

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.490
Perhaps he truly lives up to his name,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.840
the Scoundrel King.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.700
How dare you!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.800
I'm complimenting your master.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.000
One with his sword,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.280
sharp as a dull nail.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.430
Why are you angry?

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.150
Besides, if he doesn't like

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.480
the title of Sword King,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.490
we can also call him Calculation King.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.740
We captured a criminal yesterday
and he arrived today.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.280
He sees the future,
acting with remarkable speed.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.940
Insolence!

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.400
That depends on how the
Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.860
and Yanmen
explain themselves to the world.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.570
Foreseeing the future

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.360
demonstrates the Sword King's abilities.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.800
Acting with remarkable speed

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800
shows the urgency of the situation.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.620
How is the Sword King at fault?

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.800
Why are you making me look bad?

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.730
This clearly...

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.070
It's clearly a matter

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.700
for the Sword King City to handle.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.460
The Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.340
is willing to entrust this matter
to the Sword King City.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.340
Sword King, please ensure the truth

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.800
comes to light.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.520
Are you kidding me,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.240
Foxy Tang?

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.620
At such a critical moment,

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.400
can't you be serious for once,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.860
instead of sabotaging me?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.090
I am always serious.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.910
I took that bastard's sword strike head-on

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.700
and then you just
handed the person over to him.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.390
I was the one who took that strike.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.110
Well...

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.720
I finally managed

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.440
to deceive you once.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.470
How can you call that deception?

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.470
How is it not?

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.530
Deception

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.960
means taking advantage of someone

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.160
when they are unaware

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.300
of your intentions.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.650
I knew your intentions clearly.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.690
I could have stood by and done nothing,

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.750
but I chose to save your life instead.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.000
So,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.720
you didn't deceive me.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.630
Instead,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.080
you owe me once again.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.300
This...

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.020
It's all the same.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.800
It's all the same.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.800
It's all the same!

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.190
Mr. Tang!

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.920
Chi,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.779
Miss Zhong,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.070
are you alright?

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.730
We're fine.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.920
Let's go.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.050
Miss Zhong.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.840
It's nothing serious.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.770
Just a minor injury.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.570
It's nothing.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.490
How about this?

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.390
Let's get on the boat first,

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.560
dress your wound,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.770
and get you a change of clothes.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.300
Thank you for your help, Miss Shei.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.830
Let's go.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.890
Foxy Tang,

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.400
you haven't answered my question yet.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.159
If I hadn't let Sword King Yu
take him away,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.400
then not just Yanmen,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.070
but the Sword Alliance would also
become enemies with Sword King City.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.310
No matter what the investigation reveals
in the future,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.700
no one would trust us

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.690
because I am deeply entangled

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.620
with this matter

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.780
and with them.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.750
So,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.800
we're just letting this go?

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.720
The lead on the Blood Ghost Pill

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.380
is lost too.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.860
And the person who tried to harm you!

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.770
Where is he now?

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.480
I know who wanted to

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.350
harm me.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.860
As for where he is now,

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.000
Jiang Qingyu can't possibly know.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.800
And regarding the Blood Ghost Pill lead,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.630
isn't it already

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.560
quite clear now?

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.630
Since we have Yu Qifeng,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.030
a more significant lead,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.560
the smaller leads can be discarded.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.460
You suspect

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.250
that old Yu is part of the Fengliu Shop?

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.920
Even if he's not part of the Fengliu Shop,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.080
he has close ties with them.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.880
Then,

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:38.720
won't Jiang Qingyu

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.450
be killed to cover up the truth?

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:43.620
Doesn't he deserve to die?

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.320
I'll be leaving soon.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.530
Shei, Zhong Chunji!

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.690
Come have some chestnuts.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.160
I need to get back to the Sword Alliance.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.760
I'll pass.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.560
I never expected this investigation

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.640
of the Hao family massacre

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.370
would lead to a series of cases.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.720
If it weren't for your help,

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.040
I wouldn't have been able to uncover

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.040
the Fengliu Shop as the mastermind.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.920
I didn't really

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.650
intend to help you, Miss Zhong.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.720
Rather, I used you

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.960
to accomplish my own goals.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.310
The one who found the true culprit
of the Hao family massacre,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.640
capturing Jiang Cheng,

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.830
and even

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.430
stopping Yu Qifeng

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.260
from taking away the prisoner

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.040
was all Chi Yun.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.220
He's the one you should thank.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.130
Thank you, Chi Yun.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.720
Don't mention it.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.850
So...

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.830
Mr. Tang, are you

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.630
planning to go to Sword King City?

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.890
There are clues there.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.800
But that's Sword King Yu's territory.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.610
Sword King City has
thousands of disciples.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.500
Yu Qifeng has the title of Sword King.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.650
The likes of Yang Shangqing

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.850
or Jiang Qingyu can't compare with him.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.350
If he's really involved,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.430
then Sword King City

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.360
is undoubtedly a dangerous place.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.270
Why not wait until I report to my master

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.730
and people from the Sword Alliance?

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:27.560
When the time comesâ€”

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.270
Miss Zhong.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.010
I've already made it clear.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.510
I am

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.230
not trying to help
the Sword Alliance solve cases,

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.230
nor do I care about

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.480
whether the Blood Ghost Pill

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.340
poses a threat to the world or not.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.000
It's just that Sword King City

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.040
happens to have the clues I need.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.510
That's the only reason I'm going there.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.480
So, Miss Zhong,

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.280
you needn't worry too much.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.680
I carved

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.920
this wooden doll in my spare time.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.160
I'd like to give it to you...

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.650
As a memento.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.680
This doll...

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:23.770
It's me?

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.000
Don't worry. Just take it.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.270
When Foxy Tang has nothing to do,

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.720
he likes to carve

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.980
these useless things.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.400
When it's cold,
you can use it as firewood.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.100
Miss Zhong.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:51.890
Miss Shei.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.720
Be safe.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.290
Take care of yourself.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.520
Next stop, Sword King City!

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.880
Shen Langhun, Shen Langhun.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.150
You caused

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.940
such a huge commotion
in the Floating Abyss.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.990
So tell me,

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.120
this mistake

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.210
has caused my Fallen Shisan Tower

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.720
severe losses.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:23.960
Who

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.650
should I send this bill to?

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.800
Aren't we going to Sword King City?

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.250
Why does it feel like

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.400
we've taken the wrong path?

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.320
What's the purpose
of going to Sword King City?

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.900
To kill that old Yu.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.030
You want to eradicate

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.700
Fengliu Shop's influence

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.810
in Sword King City completely,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.460
so the people behind it

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.080
will have nowhere to hide.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.000
That's what I'm here for.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.390
If you say you can make Yu Qifeng

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.720
so angry he vomits blood, I'll believe it.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.930
But when it comes to

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.550
lurking in the shadows and finding clues,

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.110
you're far from qualified.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.790
Even your compliment in the first half

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.990
doesn't sound like a compliment at all.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.310
What's your plan?

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.440
We need someone...

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.960
who's skilled at undercover work.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.390
Don't you always claim

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.200
to be the best in the world?

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.620
Now you're at a loss too

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.080
and need to find an expert?

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.200
My martial arts skills
are indeed superior,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.840
but

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.590
I still have you tagging along, don't I?

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.600
Are you saying

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.230
I'm holding you back?

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.200
What's going on?

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:12.770
Hold on tight.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:13.630
Whaâ€”

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.600
Don't throw up on my boat.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.120
I never thought

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.440
that I would get seasick too.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.010
Foxy Tang,

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.400
what exactly are you planning?

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.840
The fog is thick.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.270
You can't tell east from west.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.080
This is...

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.670
The Fallen Shisan Tower?

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.000
Wasn't it said that only the Buhuan Tower

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.030
has the path

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:54.200
to Fallen Shisan Tower?

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.630
I've been to Buhuan Tower

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.510
so many times,

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.310
but I've never come here before.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.800
How do you know about this place?

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.060
This is probably the difference between

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:03.790
ordinary guests and VIPs.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.480
You damn fox.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.080
Chi Yun,

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.080
I became their VIP

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.510
thanks to you.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.040
By the way,

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.250
you still haven't told me
why you came here.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.710
Didn't I tell you already?

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:21.270
I need an assassin

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.150
skilled at stealth and tracking.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.240
You mean

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.440
the one known to kill all with one strike,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.630
Shisan Tower's

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.390
Shen Langhun?

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.030
Yes,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.490
Shen Langhun.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.610
[Fallen Shisan Tower]

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.360
Although I've never been here

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.670
to the Fallen Shisan Tower,

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:20.910
I'm sure it's full of

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.640
all kinds of shady characters.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.350
If a fight breaks out later...

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.790
Hey, wait for me!

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:50.440
[Fallen Shisan Tower]

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.390
Chi Yun.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.200
Are you looking for me?

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.770
I'm right here.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.030
You finally came.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.040
Hurry, rescue me from here.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.980
Chi Yun, come quickly.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:59.990
Come a little closer.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:08.770
Chi Yun.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:10.790
Chi Yun.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.440
I'm over here.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:13.960
Come quickly.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.170
Chi Yun.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:22.589
That's the Soul-Capturing Alliance
of the Shisan Tower.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:23.720
They bewitch people's minds

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.520
to extort money from customers.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.810
Strange people.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.570
Strange building too.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.770
Mr. Tang, you're truly knowledgeable.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.480
My little

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.680
business tricks

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
can't escape your keen eyes.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:43.780
Mr. Tang,

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:45.280
Cloud.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.110
Old customers!

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.780
Having an honored guest come,

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.070
the Shisan Tower is truly

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.350
brightened by your presence.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.600
Since we last parted,

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.680
your habit of scaring people

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.420
hasn't changed at all.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.320
Speaking of last time...

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.680
Cloud,

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.160
you haven't exchanged messages
with Buhuan Tower again.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.070
Have you found

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.640
your wife, Bai Suche?

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.510
Why don't you quickly dissolve

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.200
your contract with Mr. Tang

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.640
and work for the Shisan Tower?

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.150
Mr. Tang,

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.380
regarding the recent incident,

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.270
Buhuan Tower suffered heavy losses.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.350
Have you come

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.240
to settle your debt with me?

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:22.840
Perhaps

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.610
this bill

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.100
should be sent to Fengliu Shop.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.920
You didn't commit the act,

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.470
but you still caused harm.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.880
Whether it's you or him,

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.430
it's all the same.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.090
Shadow Concealment Technique?

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.350
Every grievance and debt has its source.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.480
You've always been a sensible person.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.000
The Shisan Tower once,
on behalf of this person,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.610
delivered a flute to me.

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:53.310
He only asked you to run an errand

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.370
but didn't tell you

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.530
the story behind this half jade flute.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.160
It seems that you, Chief,

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.030
are also one of his pawns.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:06.110
Mr. Tang,

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.380
four years ago,

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:09.930
you died.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.920
So what?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.930
A broken flute cannot be rejoined,

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.160
yet a dead person can come back to life.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.640
I'm very curious

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.580
about the secret behind this.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.310
Chief, your curiosity

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.750
won't help you do business.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.630
Since you're here for business,

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.610
what do you seek?

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.770
You have eyes and ears everywhere.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.030
You must already know

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.070
why I'm here.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.200
Today, I've come

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.200
to request the services
of Shisan Tower's top assassin,

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.200
Shen Langhun,

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.750
for one year.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.070
This isn't your first time

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.200
doing business with the Shisan Tower.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.880
You should know our rules.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.550
I don't make a habit of buying on credit.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.880
Please name your price.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.480
Foxy Tang, be careful.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.510
He's utterly ruthless.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.440
What if what I want

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:13.610
is you?

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.380
That would be difficult.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.680
I consider myself

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.540
more valuable than Shen Langhun.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.560
Perhaps you could pay the difference?

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.470
What a pity.

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:28.000
I'm interested, but you are not.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.730
If you want Shen Langhun...

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.720
you'll have to come upstairs
to find him yourself.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.050
Go! I'll cover you.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.800
Shadow Concealment Technique?

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.560
Chi Yun, you've grown taller.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.290
What?

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.520
What the hell is that?

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.040
Foxy Tang,

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.640
can you speak properly?

00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:58.980
Mr. Tang,

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.000
four years ago, Liu Yan slit your throat

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.400
and threw you into a well.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.000
No one could survive

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.330
in such circumstances.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.640
But now,

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.640
you're not only alive

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.830
and standing here,

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.590
but also stirring up

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.740
tremendous waves in the jianghu.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.740
Mr. Tang,

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.740
is your secret of not dying

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.540
derived from your body

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.880
or from the martial arts you practice?

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.050
Chief, your life
is already hanging by a thread.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.810
Why bother asking about things

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.530
that don't concern you?

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.750
Is that so?

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.070
But what if

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:42.800
I insist on knowing the answer?

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.590
You should know

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:48.340
that the more you know,
the faster you'll die.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.890
Is this all you're capable of?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.240
With such limited skills,

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.990
you're not worthy of hearing my secrets.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:09.450
I built this tower
with all my heart and soul.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.920
You haven't seen even half of it yet.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.560
Die!

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:02.880
Gui Fusheng?

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.210
Take it back.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.230
Turns out the mechanisms
of the Fallen Shisan Tower

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.790
were created
by the world's greatest puppet master,

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.960
Gui Fusheng.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:56.710
Mr. Tang.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:59.270
You think just because you won't talk,

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:00.960
the Shisan Tower won't find out

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.020
about your secret?

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:04.020
Do you know

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.200
that before the Shisan Tower,

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.440
no secret can remain hidden?

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.520
Foxy Tang!

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.830
Mr. Tang,

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.060
your martial arts skills
are indeed impressive,

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:21.720
but I

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.680
have yet to witness that one move

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.240
I've been longing to see.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.900
Why must you be so persistent?

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:28.380
All will be seen from the tower.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.840
Where is the person I want?

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.480
Mr. Tang,

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.480
being stubborn is wrong,

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.920
but so is

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.270
being arrogant.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.020
You're finally here,

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:14.680
Shen Langhun

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:18.850
Mr. Tang, when you strike,

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.480
you always turn sideways.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.000
When turning,

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:24.310
your energy flow is clearly obstructed.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.640
You have an old wound in your abdomen

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:28.920
that cannot be healed.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:31.160
Am I right?

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.060
You've hidden it well,

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.710
but I have still

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.200
managed to see through it.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:42.640
Back in the day,

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.520
seven great masters fought against
Yique Yinyang.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.810
Fang Zhou deserved the greatest credit.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.170
After that battle,

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.240
he was honored as the world's greatest.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.310
Tang Lici,

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.240
could your abdomen wound

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.440
be from Fang Zhou?

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:08.200
Shen Langhun,

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:09.780
attack his old wound.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:57.960
Snake Fang...

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.440
Soul Breaker!

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:13.640
Got him.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.070
This is...

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.070
Since you insisted on seeing it,

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.330
then

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.120
watch this carefully.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.600
I understand now.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.160
I understand now!

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.880
You're just like him.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.270
The infinite secrets of human and man,

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:47.400
the Liuli Rebirth Scroll.

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:49.480
Only the Rebirth Scroll

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.750
can continuously transform
and sustain life,

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.400
allowing you
to recover from severe injuries

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.790
and come back to life.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.350
But why?

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.070
But why

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.600
do you possess
Yique Yinyang's martial arts?

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:06.430
And also,

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.620
that wound on your abdomen

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.920
that even the Rebirth Scroll

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.640
cannot heal...

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.980
What exactly is it?

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.590
If you want to
peek into the darkness of one's heart,

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.790
be careful not to get dragged into
the darkness yourself.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.440
Tang Lici,

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.190
you amuse me greatly.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.230
You can take Shen Langhun away,

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.370
but whether he'll obey you

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:40.830
depends on your ability.

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:44.750
Isn't it just a fair exchange of

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.080
paying money for a life?

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.830
Since when did the Shisan Tower

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.200
add this new rule?

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.110
That has never been

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.110
the rule of the Fallen Shisan Tower.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:57.170
It was established four years ago

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:00.640
by Shen Langhun himself.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.110
Sword King,

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.380
you finally came.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.090
If you hadn't personally intervened,

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:43.880
I would certainly

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.920
have been taken away by

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.710
that little girl
from the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.570
I won't ask you for anything more.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.150
I only ask that you allow me
to leave the city.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:53.679
Let me go to the countryside

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.020
and live as an ordinary villager.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.510
Sword King!

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.030
Sword King, rest assured.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.290
I'm very tight-lipped

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.340
and won't implicate the Sword King City.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.900
About you selling me the medicine,

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.300
I haven't mentioned
a single word about it.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:27.320
Who did you say

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:31.190
sold you the medicine?

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:58.800
The Sword King is tired.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.630
I need to help him relax.

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:02.170
Clean up

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.190
and leave us.

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.310
Yes, Madam Bai.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.230
What you just did

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:23.930
was not wise.

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:27.360
This matter could have been
handled more elegantly.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.760
The suspect Jiang Qingyu

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.510
feared revenge
from the Fengliu Shop's inhuman forces

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:33.110
and committed suicide out of guilt.

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:35.000
But your impulsive strike

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.760
has needlessly cut off this approach.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:39.730
I am the Sword King.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.000
Why bother with such deception?

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.590
If I say
he committed suicide out of guilt,

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.120
then that's what happened.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.160
Who dares to question it?

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:48.510
You are so bold.

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:49.590
It seems Fengliu Shop

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.150
sending me to assist the Sword King

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:52.550
was unnecessary.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.960
I hope in a few days

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.340
when questioned by
the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.220
you will show the same courage.

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.080
Master, you worry too much.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.360
Those incompetent and ignorant elders

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.510
can do nothing to me.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.760
What about Tang Lici,

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.110
the one at Yanmen Fort who withstood

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:09.150
your strike?

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.730
[Central Plains Sword Alliance]

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.140
That's what happened.

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:28.130
After that,

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.890
Sword King Yu left with the man.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:30.840
I believe

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.850
the case of the Blood Ghost Pill

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:34.910
must be connected to Sword King City.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.280
Please investigate thoroughly, Master.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.070
Nonsense!

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:40.480
Do you know

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.610
who Sword King Yu is?

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.730
Since the Yu family's ancestors

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:45.790
founded Phoenix Manor 300 years ago,

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.120
10 generations of renowned Sword Kings

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.320
have had the reputation
of Sword Grandmaster.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.070
Moreover, Yu Xuanqing the Sword Phoenix

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.360
had joined Head Fang and other masters

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.880
10 years ago at Tiandu Peak,

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.080
and jointly eliminated Yique Yinyang.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.250
He's truly an exemplar of our time.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.600
Now, you dare accuse Sword King Yu

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:03.230
of colluding with Fengliu Shop

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:05.150
to sell Blood Ghost Pills?

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:06.960
Sword Master Jiang,

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.210
Jiang Qingyu was just captured,

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.590
and Sword King Yu arrived right after.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.400
How could he have such timely information?

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.130
If you want to suspect someone,

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.440
you should first suspect Tang Lici.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.360
You said the black-clad pipa player

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.160
disguised himself as Tang Lici,

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:22.440
intending to bring up

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.160
the unsolved case of Zhoudi Tower.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.690
But have you all considered

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.590
that if the black-clad pipa player

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:29.590
had no real connection,

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.070
how could he stir up so much trouble?

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.280
Now, someone has finally

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.710
delivered a clue to our doorstep.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:36.060
Instead of tracking him down

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.990
to investigate Head Fang's death,

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.050
you're letting him lead you on.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.670
That's right.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:43.150
This person hid for four years.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.000
As soon as he appeared,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.360
he caused so much trouble.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.880
The Ranqing Sect was massacred.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.840
Some people say

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.880
Tang Lici is the real culprit
behind it all.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.140
He was clearly framed.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.070
You should know

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.800
that when
the Ranqing Sect incident happened,

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.710
Tang Lici and I
were both at Yanmen Fort.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:56.550
Their attempt to use the same trick

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:57.280
is so clumsy.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.400
Can't you all see through it?

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.530
You should know

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:01.710
the one who massacred

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:02.960
the Ranqing Sect was a woman in red.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.360
When you were at Yanmen Fort,

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.440
did you see her?

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.550
If Tang Lici wanted to do evil,

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.230
why would he need to act personally?

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:10.630
Perhaps that black-clad pipa player

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:11.960
is also his accomplice.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.560
Chunji, your experience in the jianghu
is still limited.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.420
You may know someone's surface
but not their heart.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.110
Sword King Yu ignored the Sword Alliance

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.310
and took the man away,

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.920
yet the Sword Alliance
only questions Tang Lici.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.440
When it comes to Sword King Yu,

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.440
don't you even dare to question him?

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.370
Since the Sword Alliance bullies the weak
and fears the strong,

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:32.610
if I handed the person over to Yu Qifeng,

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:34.340
wouldn't I be doing you a favor?

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:35.550
You've just become

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:36.550
the Branch Chief of Shanfeng Branch.

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:37.840
Have you already disregarded

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.760
the Sword Alliance

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.000
and us Sword Masters?

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.510
For an outsider like Tang Lici,

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:46.010
you're actually arguing with us.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.880
I've said it before.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.310
She's too young and incompetent.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.710
Coming from the lowest class,

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:54.930
she's also shortsighted.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.110
Second Sword Master,

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.110
why make it about

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:02.170
the Third Sword Master for no reason?

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.560
She used to be a butcher.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:04.840
What's it to you?

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.190
I never said that.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:07.880
When you were scolding Chunji,

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.270
you should have just stated the issue.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:10.330
Why call her lowly?

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.880
Everyone,

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.760
don't embarrass ourselves
before the younger generation.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.720
The Sword King
is also a member of the Sword Alliance.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.250
The trial of the Yanmen case

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:21.020
is perfectly appropriate.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:24.480
Chunji,

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.280
you may leave now.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.430
But...

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:29.390
Don't worry. Leave this to me.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.510
Yes.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:45.900
Chunji is still young.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.700
She spoke inappropriately.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.620
I, Shao,

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.920
would like to apologize

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.720
to all the masters on her behalf.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:57.670
-Master Shao, you're too kind.
-Master Shao, you're too kind.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:58.230
Please sit down.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.880
Please sit down.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.740
Please, do sit.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:02.760
The Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.480
was entrusted by our predecessor

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.480
Jiang Nanfeng with the Tai'e Sword.

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:07.390
In overseeing jianghu affairs,

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.110
we must proceed with caution

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:10.840
and be neither unjust nor lenient.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.030
The massacre of Hao Wenhou's family,

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:13.510
the evil pills in Yanmen,

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.360
the slaughter of the Ranqing Sect,

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.320
and the mysterious Fengliu Shop
behind everything

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.690
all must be investigated.

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:19.350
Otherwise,

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:20.480
wouldn't we be failing

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.280
the trust of all martial heroes?

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.170
Master Shao,

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.110
what are your plans?

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:28.030
The Yu family's Sword Duel Festival
is approaching.

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:30.840
Heroes from across the land will gather
at Feifeng Mountain.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.640
Regarding the Blood Ghost Pill,

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:34.670
we'll see how Sword King Yu

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:35.960
will provide the world with

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.980
an explanation.

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:39.670
Yanmen has suffered a sudden tragedy.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.600
Master Jiang must be heartbroken.

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:43.820
I'll write a personal letter.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:44.360
Lao Liu,

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:45.960
you will go to Yanmen

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.490
to offer condolences on my behalf.

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:48.650
As for Tang Lici,

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.150
he's mysterious and strange person.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:51.960
I will find

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.290
a suitable candidate to investigate him.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:42:01.110
-I will obey the Sword Master's orders.
-I will obey the Sword Master's orders.

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:52.400
Mom.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:54.110
The meat is here.

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:55.190
Mom, I'm back!
